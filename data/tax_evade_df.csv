https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn01dv27d92o,2025-01-14T16:20:36Z,"Controversial online influencer Andrew Tate has been released from house arrest by a Romanian court, pending the outcome of a criminal investigation, his spokesman has said.

He has instead been put under judicial control, meaning he can travel through Romania ""while adhering to the required legal conditions"", the spokesman added.

Tate, 38, is facing allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering, alongside his brother Tristan. Both have strongly denied the charges.

The spokesman added: ""Andrew Tate and his team remain committed to full cooperation and the pursuit of justice.""

Tate was put under house arrest in August when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against himself and Tristan Tate, as well as four other suspects, over allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They all deny wrongdoing.

A first, separate case against the brothers was sent back to prosecutors by the Court of Appeals in Bucharest in December for the second time, saying it could not proceed in its current form.

In this case, Andrew and Tristan Tate were accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women.

They deny these allegations too, as well as those of rape and human trafficking that have been made against them in the UK, where police are seeking to extradite the dual UK-US nationals.

A judge in Bucharest has previously said that extradition request will be dealt with after the conclusion of the case in Romania.

The brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. Last month, a British court ruled that police could seize more than £2m ($2.4m) from them for failing to pay tax on £21m in revenue from their online businesses.

Andrew Tate said the ruling was ""not justice"" and called it a ""co-ordinated attack"".

He is a self-described misogynist and has previously been banned from social media platforms for expressing those views.

A former kickboxer, he has gained millions of followers online and has lived in Romania for a number of years, having previously been based in the UK."

BBC News and File on 4 Investigates

It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.

And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.

Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.

""There has been tax evasion,"" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. ""This is criminal.""

In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had ""always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice"" and ""acted in accordance"" with it.

The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.

Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (£559m).

The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.

They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.

The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.

The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.

Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.

'Aware of the risks'

The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed ""Operating Structure"" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.

""We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,"" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.

Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected ""so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure"", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.

Mr Holloway warned them they should be ""aware of the risks"". He wrote: ""We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.""

Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate ""customer"" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any ""common link"" that might arouse suspicion.

As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.

Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.

'Hide the reality'

The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an ""artificial structure"" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.

""My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion… because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,"" he said.

Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme ""indications"" that they ""may be misrepresenting information"".

""If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,"" she added.

Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he ""joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time"".

He said he had ""managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world"". ""I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,"" he said, adding that he ""used structures others in the industry were using"".

Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied ""any allegation that he had any knowledge"" or was ""personally responsible"" or liable for ""any alleged deception of any government authority"" to evade tax.

His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that ""similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running"" of the companies involved in the scheme.

If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.

This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.

A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.

""At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,"" he wrote.

There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.

In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (£35,000) in tax.

In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.

A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.

This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial ""look"" of the operation was a sham.

'Lawyers got onto it'

Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.

Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.

Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.

But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and ""their lawyers got onto it"", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.

Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers ""produced documentation"" proving Pelorus was ""entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire"".

Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.

In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to €17m (£14.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be ""zero-rated"" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.

Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were ""unreasonable and oppressive"", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.

We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.

According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were ""engaged in economic activity"" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.

In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of €14m (£11.8m).

We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.

https://reason.com/volokh/2025/01/16/tom-goldstein-was-indicted-on-tax-evasion-charges/,2025-01-16T22:02:18Z,"Last year I wrote a post title A Requiem for SCOTUSBlog. Publisher Tom Goldstein had announced that the site would be scaling back its coverage of the Court. SCOTUSBlog remains functional, but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as it used to be.

Today's news, however, may signal a real farewell to SCOTUSBlog.

Tom Goldstein was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on charges of tax evasion, willful failure to pay taxes, false statements, and other charges. The indictment contains some stunning allegations (of course Goldstein remains innocent until proven guilty):

6. In addition to the legal work he performed at G&R [Goldstein & Russell], GOLDSTEIN was also an ultrahigh-stakes poker player, frequently playing in matches or series of matches in the United States and abroad involving stakes totaling millions, and even tens of millions, of dollars. GOLDSTEIN's poker activities included both ""ring games"" (which typically involved five or more players) as well as ""heads-up"" matches (which were two-player matches). . . .

10. To make and receive payments related to his gambling and certain other private activities between 2016 and 2022, GOLDSTEIN typically used a personal bank account (''the Gambling Account"") over which he exercised exclusive control and authority, including the authority to effectuate transfers. The G&R firm managers did not have access to the Gambling Account. By contrast, GOLDSTEIN permitted the G&R firm managers to share authority with respect to the G&R bank accounts, as well as a different personal bank account for GOLDS1EIN and his wife, through which the G&R firm managers, as part of their official duties, paid certain of GOLDSTEIN's personal bills. . . .

24. Between 2016 and 2022, GOLDSTEIN engaged in a scheme to evade the assessment of taxes, file false tax returns, and fail to pay his tax obligations when they were due.

The allegations go on.

I do not have much to say about these substantive offenses. But I worry that this news may spell the end of SCOTUSBlog. Indeed, the indictment will seek criminal forfeiture of ""any property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the offenses."" Does SCOTUSBlog fall in that category? If so, I hope someone else acquires SCOTUSBlog. It would be a shame to lose this valuable resource.

Update: Shortly after my post went up, I received a statement from a rep for Goldstein:

Hello - Reaching out on behalf of Tom Goldstein, I saw your story. Here is a statement attributed to John Lauro of Lauro & Singer and Christopher Kise of Continental, trial counsel for Mr. Goldstein:

""Mr. Goldstein is a prominent attorney with an impeccable reputation. We are deeply disappointed that the government brought these charges in a rush to judgment without understanding all of the important facts. Our client intends to vigorously contest these charges and we expect he will be exonerated at trial."""
https://www.mediaite.com/crime/scotusblog-publisher-indicted-for-tax-evasion-accused-of-misusing-funds-to-cover-gambling-debts/,2025-01-16T21:50:46Z,"Tom Goldstein, the publisher of the popular Supreme Court news site SCOTUSblog and veteran practitioner before the nation’s highest court himself, was indicted Thursday for tax evasion related to a stunning series of alleged schemes to use funds from his law firm to cover millions of dollars of gambling debts, Law360 reported.

Goldstein’s biography on the SCOTUSblog website says that he earned his undergraduate degree from UNC Chapel Hill and his law degree from American University’s Washington College of Law, as well as receiving an Honorary Doctorate from that institution.

His practice included arguing more than 40 cases at the Supreme Court, including a landmark copyright case, Google v. Oracle. Goldstein retired from appellate practice in 2023 from the law firm he founded, Goldstein & Russell; the firm subsequently rebranded as Goldstein, Russell & Woofter, with partners Kevin Russell and Daniel Woofter in charge.

The criminal charges relate to alleged actions before Goldstein’s retirement, taking place between 2016 and 2022, describing the attorney as an “ultrahigh-stakes poker player” who bet on games with “stakes totaling millions, and even tens of millions of dollars,” reported Law360’s Phillip Bantz. The indictment was filed in Maryland federal court, due to Goldstein’s law firm being located in Bethesda, and accuses him of conducting a scheme to “evade the assessment of taxes, file false tax returns and fail to pay his tax obligations when they were due.”

As the sole owner at the time of the law firm, Goldstein “allegedly used millions of dollars in funds” from the firm “to cover gambling debts and other personal debts and falsely understated his gambling winnings by millions of dollars in tax filings, according to the indictment,” wrote Bantz, adding additional scandalous accusations against the lawyer:

He also is accused of entering into sham employment arrangements with four women who he was in “intimate personal relationships with” or was pursuing. Goldstein allegedly listed the women as “employees” of his law firm, paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars and set them up with health insurance policies through the firm, while they “performed little or no work for the firm.”

The indictment says that Goldstein allegedly owes “substantial amounts of money to the IRS.”

Goldstein’s previous law firm has already rebranded again to Russell & Woofter LLC on its website, removing most mentions of Goldstein. Court filings and blog posts on the firm website show it was using the name “Goldstein, Russell & Woofter LLC” through 2024.

Law360 updated its original article “to clarify the number of women with whom Goldstein is accused of entering sham employment relationships,” and this article has also been updated accordingly.

UPDATE 5:45 pm ET: Trial counsel for Mr. Goldstein, John Lauro of Lauro & Singer and Christopher Kise of Continental, reached out to Mediaite with the following statement:

Mr. Goldstein is a prominent attorney with an impeccable reputation. We are deeply disappointed that the government brought these charges in a rush to judgment without understanding all of the important facts. Our client intends to vigorously contest these charges and we expect he will be exonerated at trial.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuasmeltzer/2025/01/27/bitcoin-jesus--maryland-lawyer-high-profile-cryptocurrency-tax-cases/,2025-01-27T15:10:56Z,"Two recent criminal tax cases, one crypto focused and one less so, show how digital assets are making their way into the normal legal process involving criminal tax enforcement.

The United States Department of Justice announced, in April 2024, that Roger Keith Ver, known by his followers as ""Bitcoin Jesus,"" was indicted on fraud and tax-related charges, including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The indictment alleged that Ver, a former California resident who expatriated to St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, concealed assets and provided false information during the expatriation process to evade taxes, including an ""exit tax"" on his Bitcoin holdings. The press release from the Department of Justice claimed that Ver allegedly sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins without reporting or paying taxes on distributions from his U.S.-based companies causing a $48 million loss to the IRS. The United States sought Ver’s extradition from Spain to stand trial. On Dec. 3, 2024, Ver filed a motion to dismiss and on Jan. 13, 2025 the government filed its opposition. This is one of the first glimpses into cryptocurrency enforcement post-election where a friendlier regulatory and enforcement landscape has been promised.

On Jan. 16, 2025, a Maryland attorney was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 charges, including tax evasion, assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, failure to pay taxes, and making false statements to mortgage lenders. Thomas C. Goldstein retired from a prominent United States Supreme Court practice, according to an ABA Journal article, in 2023 indicating that the change in the Supreme Court made it difficult to fight for the little guy. Now he faces charges that, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, could result in decades in prison. Most of the allegations in the indictment involve omitting legal fee income, misreporting gambling winnings and debts, or are related to alleged “sham employment relationships” with several women the government claims were involved in intimate relationships with Goldstein. Amid the scandalous claims involving gambling, infidelity, and duffel bags of cash the indictment also claims Goldstein conducted 280 cryptocurrency transactions but answered “no” on his tax return about making any virtual currency transactions.

Can The DOJ Finally Reach Bitcoin Jesus?

In his motion to dismiss, Ver (a.k.a. Bitcoin Jesus), claimed the exit tax itself violated the constitution, that the legal standards involving cryptocurrency’s tax treatment were unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence used in the indictment was incomplete and that full versions show that Ver made every attempt to properly follow the tax laws. Many tax advisors, including this author, have struggled to answer difficult questions regarding digital assets when the limited IRS guidance doesn’t address the issues involved. Both the indictment and the motion to dismiss outline that Ver did, in fact, seek legal and tax advice during a time when little guidance was provided by the government.

In its opposition the governments first argument is for the court to ignore the motion to dismiss entirely until Ver is extradited under the “Fugitive Entitlement Doctrine.” Essentially, if you’re a fugitive you are not entitled to use of the courts for pre-trial claims such as Ver’s motion to dismiss. Since Ver didn’t actually flee the United States because of criminal prosecution (i.e. he had already expatriated years before) the government claims “constructive flight” and other equitable arguments to avoid a decision on the motion to dismiss. Perhaps assuming these equitable arguments might fail, the government addresses the merits as well. First, the United States claims that not all counts involve the exit tax so even if the exit tax is determined to be unconstitutional other counts remain. The government’s opposition then attacks Ver’s constitutional claims.

Ver’s constitutional arguments includes reliance on the recently decided Supreme Court ruling in Moore v. United States. According to Ver, unrealized appreciation in the value of an asset cannot be taxed as income and because the exit tax taxes this unrealized appreciation it is unconstitutional. The government responds that realization doesn’t determine constitutionality, and such a strict requirement would call into question numerous other taxes based on constructive sales. Ver’s remaining constitutional arguments rely on violations of due process and the vagueness of tax laws involving cryptocurrency. While there are legitimate complaints about lack of guidance and the hardships caused by the decision to expatriate, it remains to be seen if those concerns are sufficient to pass the legal standards required to make a law unconstitutional. At the very least, the arguments raise the questions about whether the government can use the threat of criminal proceedings on tax laws that are arguably lacking the required guidance for analysis on the proper tax treatment. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is currently set for Feb. 10, 2025.

Will Crypto Become Common In Criminal Tax Cases?

Unlike Ver, Goldstein is not alleged to be an early adopter of cryptocurrency. Although the indictment includes allegations from as far back as 2016, the claims regarding financial interests in cryptocurrency are only alleged for his 2020 and 2021 tax returns. Also, in Counts 13 and 14 of the indictment, it is alleged that Goldstein aided and assisted in the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return by answering “No” to the question asking if he had received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency. Previous criminal indictments for misreporting cryptocurrency transactions, like the indictment against Ver, involve earlier tax years when this question was not included on an individual tax return (IRS Form 1040).

The question regarding transactions in cryptocurrency first appeared on the IRS Form 1040 in 2019 but was included in Schedule 1 for that tax return. The 2020 version of IRS Form 1040, the first tax year at issue in the indictment, moved the question to a much more prominent spot, right after entering your name and address. A similar question about whether taxpayers had interests in foreign bank accounts was also contained in a Schedule to the Form 1040 and subsequent litigation called into question whether the question was affirmatively not answered or just overlooked. For criminal tax cases, this makes proving the key attribute of willfulness more problematic. Presumably, the IRS, knowing about this previous problem with foreign bank accounts, decided to move the virtual currency question to its more conspicuous place on the return."
http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/todd-chrisley-claims-prison-guards-are-mistreating-him-due-to-trump-support/,2025-02-05T16:08:30Z,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

Todd Chrisley claims that he’s a victim of anti-MAGA discrimination.

Chrisley is currently behind bars serving a 12-year sentence on fraud and tax evasion charges.

And he claims that at least one guard has singled him out for mistreatment due to his support of President Donald Trump.

Todd Chrisley Claims He’s Being Victimized By Anti-Trump Guards

According to a new report from TMZ, Todd recently told his lawyer that an irate corrections officer removed a “Make America Great Again” sticker from a chair in his cell.

Chrisley alleged that other prisoners were allowed to keep the stickers in their cells.

The TMZ report claims that “Todd believes guards are against him because he supports Trump.”

The Truth of the Matter

Of course, it seems somewhat improbable that a bunch of Florida prison guards would be so vehemently anti-Trump that they would be willing to risk their jobs over it.

The more likely explanation here is that Todd is taking a page from Joe Exotic’s playbook and trying to score a pardon from Trump.

As you may recall, the Tiger King star was locked up on murder-for-hire charges back in 2019. He’s been appealing to Trump for a pardon ever since, but to no avail.

Now, Chrisley’s attorney, Jay Surgent, is angling for a pardon — but he probably won’t be any more successful.

The Case Against the Chrisleys

Todd and wife Julie Chrisley were both convicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to commit bank fraud in 2022.

And their lawyer is still insisting that the charges were bogus.

“Todd and his wife would like to be considered for pardon, but it will be up to President Trump to review their cases,” says Surgent.

“Todd has faith he will be given due consideration, because he feels that he never received constitutional protections in a fair criminal justice system.”

Chrisley’s daughter Savannah spoke at last year’s Republican National Convention, so Trump is probably aware of the family’s story.

But unless new evidence emerges in the Chrisleys’ favor, they’ll probably have to wait for the end of Trump’s term to receive a pardon.

Throughout his incarceration, Todd has made numerous allegations against FPC Pensacola and its guards.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons tells TMZ that it’s “committed to ensuring the safety and security of the individuals in our custody, our employees, and the public,” adding:

“Allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true, including the possibility of referral for criminal prosecution when appropriate.”

We’ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2025/01/23/7-criminal-charges-filed-in-massive-covid-related-tax-credit-scheme/,2025-01-23T14:30:37Z,"During and after the Covid-19 pandemic, the employee retention credit became a massive source of new business for many accountants and other tax professionals. But as has been widely reported for years, the IRS often pushed back on aggressive and downright bogus claims. There were also plenty of good faith interpretive questions, where taxpayers and their advisers believed they qualified for the credit but where the IRS said otherwise.

Some claims, though, were beyond the pale, and even have become criminal tax cases. Can a tax audit lead to serious criminal charges? In some cases yes. A case is point is a new federal indictment that charges seven individuals with operating a multi-state conspiracy to defraud the United States of more than $600 million via filing more than 8,000 false tax returns claiming Covid-19-related employment tax credits. The Department of Justice news release is here.

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic impact, Congress authorized a tax credit that incentivized businesses to keep employees on their payroll, also known as the “Employee Retention Credit” or ERC. Congress also authorized a credit that reimbursed businesses for the wages paid to employees who were on sick or family leave and could not work because of Covid-19. This “Paid Sick and Family Leave Credit,” or SFLC, was equal to the wages the business paid the employees during their leave.

The indictment alleges that from November 2021 to June 2023, defendants Keith Williams, Jamari Lewis, Morais Dicks, Janine Davis, Tiffany Williams, James Hames Jr. and Ewendra Mathurin, all current or former New York residents, repeatedly exploited these programs that were intended to help businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The scheme was allegedly headquartered at Credit Reset, a purported credit repair business that Keith Williams owned and operated. Acting as tax preparers, the defendants allegedly filed more than 8,000 false employment tax returns with the IRS claiming Covid-related tax credits on behalf of themselves and their clients.

Each of these tax returns were allegedly fraudulent in that they claimed SFLC in excess of the amount of wages reported on the tax return, listed the same wages as both qualified sick leave wages and qualified family leave wages or claimed the SFLC and ERC for the same wages, none of which was permitted by law. The defendants allegedly profited from the scheme by receiving tax refund checks from the U.S. Treasury and by charging clients a fee or a percentage of the tax refund the client received.

The defendants also allegedly recruited others into the scheme, who were compensated by receiving a percentage of fraudulently obtained U.S. Treasury checks. In total, the defendants sought more than $600 million of which the IRS paid approximately $45 million to the defendants and their clients.

The indictment claims that the defendants concealed their preparation of the false tax returns by not listing themselves as the paid preparer on the tax returns, and by using Virtual Private Networks to obscure their IP addresses while filing the false returns. For clients without a business, the indictment alleges, members of the conspiracy would sell shell companies to the clients in order to file false tax returns.

How was this ring uncovered? The indictment notes that after noticing discrepancies in the filed returns, the IRS and Social Security Administration allegedly requested additional information regarding the tax returns the defendants prepared. In response, members of the conspiracy allegedly would often transmit false information to the IRS and SSA. Some of the defendants also allegedly submitted false Paycheck Protection Program loan applications.

The defendants were charged with 45 counts relating to the scheme, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns. Keith Williams, Lewis, Mathurin, Davis, Tiffany Williams and Dicks were also charged with wire fraud in relation to fraudulent PPP applications they submitted.

Make no mistake, these are serious charges. If convicted, the defendants face very serious prison time:

A maximum penalty of five years in prison for the conspiracy to defraud the United States charge;

A maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud charge arising out of the ERC scheme;

A maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for each wire fraud charge arising out of the PPP fraud; and

A maximum penalty of three years in prison for each charge of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false return charge.

This is only an indictment, and the government must prove its case to obtain a conviction. But if the seven defendants are found guilty, the potential prison time is lengthy."

https://decrypt.co/302967/bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-begs-trump-pardon,2025-01-27T20:35:20Z,"Crypto entrepreneur and alleged criminal Roger “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver is pleading with President Donald Trump for a pardon—but Trump confidant and Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said that Ver’s renounced U.S. citizenship makes that impossible.

Musk, the tech titan and close President Trump ally—not to mention noted Dogecoin fan and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE—said on X (formerly Twitter) Sunday that Ver would not get pardoned because of the move.

Ver, 46, is facing jail time after the feds last year charged him with avoiding paying $50 million in taxes, along with alleged mail fraud and filing false tax returns. He is now campaigning for President Trump’s help via social media posts.

“Roger Ver gave up his U.S. citizenship,” Musk, the world’s richest man, wrote on X. “No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges,” he added in response to an X user’s questions.

The topic of pardons is currently a hot one after President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise and last week released Silk Road founder and Bitcoin enthusiast Ross Ulbricht.

Ulbricht was serving two life terms plus 40 years without parole for running a dark web marketplace that was largely used to buy drugs via BTC. Libertarians, Bitcoiners, and the wider crypto community had lobbied the President to release Ulbricht, arguing that his sentence was too harsh.

Now Ver, one of the earliest investors in Bitcoin, is hoping for the same result from President Trump. On Sunday, he released a dramatic video begging the new commander in chief to clear his charges.

Ver did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s questions. On Monday, he released another clip—lasting 20 minutes—claiming that, “For decades, I’ve been terrorized by rogue U.S. government agents who hate American freedom.”

Crypto entrepreneur Ver earned the name “Bitcoin Jesus” because he used to give away the cryptocurrency for free when it was worth next to nothing, and heavily invested in the cryptosphere’s earliest companies.

But Ver switched to promoting Bitcoin spinoff Bitcoin Cash, and has since been trying to grow the coin. He claims Bitcoin Cash is the “real” Bitcoin, and has rubbed the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency’s community the wrong way with his aggressive marketing.

Ver, who served prison time in 2002 for selling explosives on eBay, renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis.

Feds nabbed Ver in Spain last year after U.S. authorities ordered his arrest, alleging that he sold Bitcoin in 2017 but had not informed the IRS about the gains he had made."

Indian authorities made demand of USD 1.4 billion from Volkswagen Group

Volkswagen, the German automobile manufacturer, has initiated legal action against Indian authorities to contest a tax demand of USD 1.4 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore), as per a report by Reuters. The Indian arm of the automaker, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Pvt Ltd has reportedly told the Mumbai High Court that the tax dispute poses a risk to the OEMs investments of USD 1.5 billion in the country. Furthermore, it will hamper the brand's foreign investments.

It is to be noted that the Indian government issued a tax notice to the Volkswagen Group in September 2024 in the view of implementation of an import strategy to pay a lower duty. Specifically, the strategy enabled the brand to break down imports of Volkswagen, Audi, and Skoda cars into individual parts.

Indian authorities have accused the German brand of importing a car in an unassembled condition. This allegedly enabled the brand to import them as ""individual parts"" coming separate shipments resulting in payment of 5-15 percent tax. However, the brand was liable to pay 30-35 percent tax because the cars should have been classified as CKD (completely knocked down) units.

Defending itself in the court challenge, Volkswagen India said that it had kept the Indian government updates of its strategy of ""part-by-part import"". Furthermore, the brand claims that it had received clarifications in its support in 2011.

Volkswagen Group further says the tax notice is ""in complete contradiction of the position held by the government (and) places at peril the very foundation of faith and trust that foreign investors would desire to have in the actions and assurances"" of the administration, as per report.

According to Reuters, there has been no reply from the Ministry of Finance and the customs official who issued the demand order, and a spokesperson for Volkswagen in Germany also did not respond at the time the story was published.

The Indian branch of Volkswagen stated that it is utilizing all legal avenues as it collaborates with authorities and is dedicated to maintaining ""full compliance"" with all applicable global and local regulations.

https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/02/03/surge-in-suspected-money-laundering-terrorist-funding-reports-linked-to-irish-crypto-services/,2025-02-03T06:00:01Z,"The volume of suspicious transaction reports relating to suspected money laundering and terrorist financing has soared as Gardaí are already struggling to cope with an unprecedented increase in reports of alleged frauds. Reports from services who facilitate cryptocurrency transactions are driving the increase.

Last year, a record 54,000 suspicious transaction reports were made by the financial sector and others, such as virtual money services, fund managers, gambling companies, auctioneers and car dealers.

The reports are made to the Revenue Commissioners, who check for tax evasion, money laundering and other crimes and are also sent to the Garda for examination and investigation.

The volume of reports has more than doubled in the last five years as virtual asset service providers (Vasps) have become more popular.

These provide electronic services for payments and transfers, as well as asset storage, for consumers and businesses dealing in conventional currencies and cryptocurrencies. They must apply to the Central Bank of Ireland for registration in the Republic.

Reporting of suspect transactions by Vasps is driving the overall surge in all types of transactions being reported to Revenue.

In 2019 there were 24,500 suspect transactions reported by the financial sector to Revenue. That increased to 52,200 in 2023 and to 54,000 last year. As recently as four years ago, banks and the credit unions accounted for almost all the suspect transactions reported in the State, but the situation has changed rapidly.

In 2019 and 2020, no reports of suspicious transactions were made by Vasps and 300 were made in 2021. Reports by Vasps of suspected transactions have increased exponentially since then – to 6,600 in 2022 and 23,800 in 2023.

In that year, 2023, Vasps became the single biggest reporter of suspect financial transactions in the Republic, ahead of all banks and credit unions combined. A breakdown of how many suspicious transactions were reported by Vasps last year was not available.

However, Revenue confirmed the overall number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from all sources made last year was 54,000, a record high.

In reply to queries, Revenue said suspicious transaction reports formed “an integral part of the overall risk profile for individual taxpayers”. When suspicious transaction reports were received, they were “examined, matched to taxpayers’ information, and used to identify and subsequently confront noncompliance”.

“Where we identify risks, we undertake the appropriate compliance intervention, matching the nature of the intervention to the nature and scale of the noncompliance or tax evasion involved. We also work closely with the financial intelligence unit of An Garda Síochána and other State agencies concerned with STRs,” Revenue said.

The Banking & Payments Federation Ireland said: “Financial institutions, as well as other regulated entities, have a legal obligation to report any transaction where they have reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing and BPFI members work very closely with An Garda Síochána to meet these reporting requirements.”

The obligation to make the reports is provided for in the Criminal Justice Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act. In 2021, the legislation was amended to widen the range of institutions, including virtual asset service providers, legally obliged to report suspicious transactions, resulting in the huge volume of reports from Vasps.

The increase in suspicious transaction reports comes just weeks after it emerged tens of thousands of reports of suspected frauds, made to the Garda by the banks and other institutions, had not yet been examined. The volume of suspected frauds has grown so large over the last two years that gardaí have been unable to process and, subsequently, assign them for investigation.

The backlog is now so large the Central Statistics Office has said the State’s official crime data, relating to frauds, will be revised upwards. The office paused publication of any further crime data last month as an interim measure."

Her success led to a television career, with appearances on shows such as ""Dance Fever"" and ""Dance Moms.""

The ""Dance Moms"" Show

Miller’s most notable television show, ""Dance Moms,"" premiered in 2011 and followed the lives of a group of young dancers competing in the National Dance Crew Championship.

However, behind the scenes, Miller was known for her strict and demanding teaching style, which often led to conflicts with her dancers.

Bankruptcy and Financial Issues

In 2011, Miller filed for bankruptcy, citing over $2.5 million in debts. The bankruptcy filing was a result of her lavish spending on her dance studio, as well as her lavish lifestyle.

The Investigation and Charges

In 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launched an investigation into Miller’s financial dealings. The investigation revealed that Miller had failed to pay taxes on her income, and that she had used her dance studio as a front for her personal spending.

Miller has since spoken publicly about the challenges she faced while in prison, including the difficulties of adjusting to life outside of a maximum-security facility.

https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/21/crypto-godfather-and-former-la-police-detective-to-plead-guilty-to-tax-crimes-and-civil-rights-violations/,2025-01-21T19:45:58Z,"A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy and a cryptocurrency businessman who dubbed himself “The Godfather” have agreed to plead guilty to tax evasion and other federal crimes.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California says Adam Iza, the founder of the crypto trading platform Zort, also known as “The Godfather,” is expected to enter a guilty plea for crimes related to extorting money from victims in Los Angeles.

Iza, who has been in federal custody since September 2024, is charged with conspiracy against rights, wire fraud and tax evasion.

Also agreeing to plead guilty is Iza’s alleged accomplice Eric Saavedra, an LASD deputy and a former federal task force officer. Saavedra intends to plead guilty to charges of conspiracy against rights and subscribing to a false tax return.

The two are expected to officially enter guilty pleas in an LA courthouse “in the coming days.”

Iza faces up to 35 years in federal prison, while Saavedra faces up to 13 years.

Says Tyler Hatcher, special agent in charge for the IRS Criminal Investigation’s Los Angeles Field Office.

“Mr. Iza’s and Mr. Saavedra’s relationship was little more than a thuggish partnership between a thief and a crooked cop. The public should be able to trust members of law enforcement, but Mr. Saavedra violated his oath for a payday. Mr. Iza stole from anyone he could and found a big payday by ripping off Meta so that he could afford to pay for Mr. Saavedra’s corrupt protection and assistance.”

According to the press release, Iza avoided $6.78 million in federal taxes in 2021 and Saavedra received about $373,146 in unreported income in the same year.

In one instance, Iza and Saavedra targeted a person Iza thought had a laptop computer with more than $100 million in cryptocurrency on it, according to federal prosecutors.

“After securing the illegal warrant, Saavedra tracked down the victim and provided the victim’s address to Iza. In March 2022, Iza caused three armed individuals to try to force entry into the victim’s home to steal the laptop. The individuals fled after the victim fired a gunshot in their direction.”

In other instances, “two LASD deputies held a victim at gunpoint inside Iza’s residence, after which Iza caused $25,000 to be transferred from the victim’s bank account to his own, and an October 2021 event in which Iza himself held a victim at gunpoint, causing that victim to transfer $127,000 to Iza.”

Iza also admitted “to stealing more than $37 million by fraudulently gaining access to Meta Platforms Inc. business manager accounts and their associated lines of credit from 2020 to 2022.”
