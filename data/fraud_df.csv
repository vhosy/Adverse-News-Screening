Unfortunately, no one warned the two imposters of this when they decided to pose as members of the FCC “Fraud Prevention Team” and they ended up calling FCC staff members. Now the company that enabled the whole fraudulent operation is staring down a $4.5 million fine.

Here’s how this whole thing went down, according to the FCC: Two people who identified themselves by the names “Christian Mitchell” and “Henry Walker” registered accounts with Telnyx, a VOIP service provider based in Texas. The two claimed to be living at the same address in Toronto, Canada, despite the fact that their IP addresses pinned them in Scotland and England, and they both had email addresses registered to the domain mariocop123.com.

Despite the indicators that something fishy was afoot, Telnyx allowed the two to register accounts anyway, which they used to launch a very short-lived spam call campaign. Over the course of two days in February 2024, the two scammers placed 1,797 imposter calls claiming to be coming from the Federal Communications Commission’s Fraud Prevention Team—a thing that does not exist.

Most of the callers ended up with a prerecorded voicemail left in their inbox. For the few unfortunate souls who picked up, the FCC said they were subjected to attempts to “threaten, intimidate, and defraud.” One victim reported that the fraudsters demanded they pay $1,000 in Google gift cards to avoid jail time for “crimes against the state.”

Somehow, at least a few of those 1,797 calls that the scammers placed managed to hit the phones of FCC staff members and their families. The FCC still isn’t sure how that happened, as the agency stated it doesn’t “publish or otherwise share staff personal phone numbers.”

However that happened, it seems to have put the whole operation on the FCC’s radar, and now it’s coming down on Telnyx for failing to comply with Know Your Customer rules designed to prevent malicious actors from making use of these networks in the first place. Per the FCC’s investigation, the VOIP firm only collected a name, email address, physical address, and IP address from the applicants, with no verification process in place to confirm that information. That, as it turns out, is how you end up facilitating a spam call operation."

22 January 2025

Jack Fenwick & Paul Seddon

Political reporter

Convicted benefits cheats who fail to pay back the taxpayer could be stripped of their driving licences, under government plans to crack down on fraud.

Those who repeatedly cheat the system and have debts of £1,000 or more could be punished with a driving ban of up to two years.

Fraudsters can already be jailed in the most serious cases - but Work and Pensions Minister Alison McGovern said it would provide an additional ""tool in the box"" to chase repayments.

The plans also include new powers to force banks to hand over account information about benefit claimants to help target investigations, echoing a scheme announced by the previous Conservative government.

But this is likely to face strong opposition from the banks and privacy campaigners.

Providing false information to obtain benefits can see fraudsters hit by fines, while serious cases of conspiracy to defraud can attract prison sentences of up to ten years, under current laws.

Pressed on whether the power to disqualify drivers would provide an additional deterrent, McGovern told BBC Breakfast it would provide a ""backstop"" to chase repayment from those determined to ""evade collection"".

She added that the department already tries to collect fraudulently claimed benefits via banks or the PAYE system, but the licence powers could help with those who still ""don't want to co-operate"".

According to latest annual figures, overpayments due to fraud amounted to £7.4bn last year, around 2.8% of total welfare spending.

A further £1.6bn (0.6%) was overpaid due to inadvertent errors by claimants, with £0.8bn (0.3%) overpaid because of errors by the DWP.

Ministers have estimated greater access to banking data could save taxpayers £1.5bn over five years, by helping DWP investigators identify suspect claims more effectively.

But campaign groups have warned that it will invade claimants' right to financial privacy, and could lead to legitimate claimants being wrongly investigated.

In a letter to Kendall in September, the directors of Big Brother Watch and Age UK described the plans as ""mass financial surveillance powers"" which they said would ""represent a severe and disproportionate intrusion into the nation's privacy"".

Tory bill failed

Currently, the department can only request such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.

The previous government argued broader powers to obtain banking information in bulk would help investigators catch previously undiscovered fraud cases.

But a Tory bill to deliver the scheme failed to make it through Parliament before July's election.

Under that plan, financial institutions would have been required to send information to the DWP about bank accounts receiving benefit payments that indicated a ""potential risk"" of fraud or error, or face fines for not complying.

An official assessment of the law said the system would be ""fully automated, running within existing banking systems"" and be rolled out gradually from 2027.

At the time, Labour attacked the Tory legislation as ""poorly delineated"" – while Tory ministers argued wide-ranging powers were necessary to ensure they could apply to all types of future banks, including accounts with newer, online-only providers.

Conservative shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said the government's bill was a ""continuation"" of work started by the previous government and Labour ""must do more to tackle the spiralling welfare budget"".

'Living abroad'

Since entering government, Labour has pledged that only ""very limited information"" will be shared with the department under its equivalent plan, but is yet to set out in detail how its system will work.

DWP minister Andrew Western confirmed last year this will include cases where claimants are ""living abroad"" without notifying the department, although a timeframe for this has yet to be specified.

Accounts could also be flagged if they are holding more than £16,000, the usual savings limit for being able to claim Universal Credit.

In a change from Tory plans, the government has said the new powers will not be used to target payments of the state pension.

Ministers have sought to reassure critics by emphasising that the DWP will not have powers to ""access"" bank accounts.

But campaigners have told the BBC they believe this is a ""misdirection"", as the measures would give DWP the power to instruct banks to access the information on its behalf."
https://gizmodo.com/theres-something-fishy-about-this-fish-tech-startup-2000553691,2025-01-22T21:34:29Z,"An Indonesian agriculture tech startup that raised hundreds of millions of dollars appears to be a giant fraud. The company, called eFishery, reportedly told investors including SoftBank that it had revenue of $752 million for the nine months through September of last year when the real amount was actually $157 million. That means its revenue was 75% lower than it had presented. You could call it a pescatarian ponzi.

eFishery says its mission is to address a surging global demand for animal protein by modernizing the fishing industry in Indonesia. eFishery develops end-to-end technology for fish farmers, from internet-connected smart feeders to a mobile app where farmers can sell their harvest. Shrimp in particular is quite high in protein, and the thinking was fish farmers in Indonesia could use modern tech to increase yields and supply a growing global population.

Alas, it seems not that many fisheries wanted what eFishery was selling: “While eFishery said it had over 400,000 fish feeders in operation at customers,” Bloomberg wrote, “initial investigations estimate it only had about 24,000.” eFishery has been in business since 2013.

Bloomberg earlier reported on the alleged fish fraud, which came to light after a whistleblower approached eFishery’s board with allegations that its numbers were not accurate. Besides the massive revenue discrepancy, company leadership told investors it had made $16 million in profit for a nine-month period when in fact it had lost $35.4 million.

eFishery’s CEO was fired after an investigation by the board quickly turned up accounting inconsistencies. The investigation remains ongoing, according to Bloomberg, but it seems like someone is about to receive the Elizabeth Holmes treatment.

What are the odds the founders of eFishery got their inspiration from 4chan?

eFishery has lost more than $152 million since its inception, according to the investigation. Thankfully its backers include the likes of G42, an AI firm controlled by the United Arab Emirates. Which is to say, they will be fine."
https://www.businessinsider.com/frank-founder-charlie-javice-fraud-trial-jpmorgan-2025-2,2025-02-04T19:52:39Z,"The feds say Javice tricked JPMorgan Chase into paying $175M for her financial aid startup, Frank.

On Tuesday, a Manhattan judge set parameters for a February 18 criminal trial.

No one can mention Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, he ruled — unless Javice opens the door.

Charlie Javice — the young tech entrepreneur accused of tricking the nation's largest bank into paying $175 million for her college financial-aid startup — once had a lot to say about Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes.

Javice called Holmes' defrauded investors ""sophisticated assholes,"" and complained that ""investors should be blamed,"" according to a pair of WhatsApp messages that were discussed at a pretrial hearing in Manhattan on Tuesday.

When Javice and her ex-number two at their startup, Frank, go on trial for allegedly defrauding JPMorgan Chase later this month, federal prosecutors will be barred from making any mention of Theranos or Holmes, a judge ruled during the hearing.

And those WhatsApp messages between Javice and codefendant Olivier Amar, in particular, are definitely not coming into evidence, he said, unless either defendant opens the door by mentioning them on the witness stand.

""The potential for prejudice outweighs anything probative,"" US District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said in precluding the use of the two messages that prosecutors had optimistically labeled ""Government Exhibit 802.""

The two WhatsApp messages are from 2022, ""in the midst of their own efforts to defraud JPMC,"" the government alleged in court papers last week, in asking the judge to allow the ""highly probative"" texts into evidence at a trial scheduled to begin February 18.

Federal prosecutors allege that over months of negotiations, Javice and Amar repeatedly lied to Chase about the success of Frank, a for-profit tech company that Javice launched at age 24 and which featured software to help students apply for college financial aid.

Javice fraudulently claimed that Fank had 4.5 million customers, prosecutors allege, and created fake spreadsheets to trick the bank into believing they existed. She personally stood to gain $45 million in stock and salary from the deal, according to prosecutors.

""The government seeks only to offer the defendants' own statements about the defendants' own contemporaneous views about Holmes' criminal conduct, while in the midst of concealing the defendants' own criminal conspiracy,"" federal prosecutors wrote in asking last week for the judge's permission to use the WhatsApp messages as trial evidence.

In the messages, Javice and Amar are ""calling the conviction 'dangerous,' and repeating many of the defenses they intend in their own case,"" prosecutors wrote.

That includes what prosecutors call a blame-the-victim defense.

""Investors should be blamed on letting a 19-year-old go rogue,"" Javice commiserated with Amar in the messages, referring to Holmes, who founded Theranos at age 19.

Perhaps most damagingly, the texts appear to show Javice drawing a distinction between a health-based fraud, like the one Holmes was convicted of, and a fraud based on financial aid.

""I think health is different,"" Javice tells her number two in the first of the two contested, and now stricken, WhatsApp messages.

""They talk about how she was unfairly treated,"" Assistant US Attorney Georgia V. Kostopoulos told the judge Tuesday, in her failed argument for admitting the messages.

""They say health is different"" the prosecutor told the judge. ""They're saying that it's different to lie about patients' health data than it is to lie about student data.""

In their own court filings, defense lawyers for Javice and Amar had asked the judge to bar any mention at trial of ""well-known, unrelated third parties convicted of fraud, specifically Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie Madoff, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Martim Skreli, which the government has signaled it intends to introduce in its case-in-chief.""

Federal prosecutors say they have no intention of mentioning any of these infamous fradusters at trial.

Javice, who was once on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, recently lost a bid to be tried separately from Amar. It was revealed at a court hearing last month that Amar plans to go on the offensive against Javice during the trial.

Both Javice and Amar have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit securities, wire, and bank fraud."
https://www.businessinsider.com/where-is-amanda-c-riley-husband-cory-riley-today-scamanda,2025-01-30T22:35:41Z,"Amanda C. Riley is serving prison time for faking cancer and scamming supporters out of thousands of dollars.

A 2023 podcast and a new docuseries cover her story, which also mentions her husband, Cory.

Cory and Amanda have two sons together. Here's where Cory is today.

The story of Amanda C. Riley, a Christian woman in California who used her now-archived blog, ""Lymphoma Can Suck It,"" to chronicle her experience after supposedly being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma was compelling from the start: A young woman blogging about having cancer in order to raise awareness and funds to help pay for her aggressive treatment was actually lying the whole time, leaching attention and more than $100,000 from her friends, family, and even strangers.

It's the reason the ""Scamanda"" podcast quickly became a megahit upon its 2023 release, and why a new ABC docuseries is telling the story for a second time, delving deeper into how Riley pulled off her scheme and how she was eventually caught.

Amanda pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in October 2021, and was sentenced to five years in federal prison in May 2022. She was also ordered to pay $105,513 in restitution to her victims. She's currently incarcerated at FMC Carswell, a federal prison in Ft. Worth, Texas, and is scheduled for release on October 15, 2026.

As of January 2025, no one else has been charged with crimes related to their involvement in Amanda's scheme. However, according to the ""Scamanda"" podcast and docuseries, family members helped her set up websites to acquire donations and contributed posts to her blog. Whether any of them knew Amanda did not actually have cancer or if they truly believed she was ill is unclear.

While Amanda's fake cancer scheme was in full force, her husband Cory Riley was simultaneously battling his ex-wife Aletta Riley in court for custody of their daughter, Jessa. Per the podcast, he cited his wife's supposed diagnosis and medical expenses to try and win custody of Jessa and get his child support payments lowered.

Here's everything we know about Cory Riley's life today.

Where is Amanda C. Riley's husband Cory Riley today?

Cory and Amanda first met when Amanda was a 17-year-old cheerleading coach hired to instruct one of Cory's then-wife Aletta's daughters — one of whom actually had cancer — how to dance. Per the podcast, Cory was about 29 years old at the time.

Related stories

Cory and Aletta eventually divorced, and he married Amanda a few years later. The couple had two sons together, Carter and Connor, whom Amanda would proclaim were ""miracles,"" since she claimed she shouldn't have been able to deliver a healthy baby while undergoing cancer treatment.

Though the family lived in the Bay Area outside of San Jose for most of the time Amanda was writing her cancer blog, they moved to Texas after Amanda lost her job as principal at Pacific Point Christian School in Gilroy, California.

""Scamanda"" podcast host Charlie Webster told Glamour in a 2023 interview that Cory was ""looking after his two kids in Texas"" where Amanda was serving her sentence."

A Maricopa County Superior Court judge last week sentenced Bridget Corinne O'Brien to two years in prison followed by three years of probation for taking advantage of programs that were put in place to help businesses stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

O'Brien was also ordered to pay $1.3 million in restitution to the federal Small Business Administration, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes' office says.

Mayes' Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, led by special agent Roy Garrison, found that O'Brien misused the federal loan funds by purchasing a $1.9 million home in Phoenix. O'Brien also used the money to travel, to purchase clothing and furniture, and to pay for volleyball lessons for one of her children, investigators found.

Crimes and sentencings:Arkansas teen homicide suspect could have ties to Phoenix, police say

O'Brien, a mother of two who has a master's degree in speech pathology, founded a Phoenix therapy clinic for children called Head to Toe Therapy, which was suspended as a provider for Arizona's Medicaid program in November 2019, state Medicaid and court records show.

A presentence report says that O'Brien's actions were ""thoughtful, intentional and perhaps prohibited money from being given to another business owner in need during a difficult time.""

O'Brien was awarded $2.9 million in U.S. Small Business Administration loans in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, court records say. Her loan applications contained ""gross material misrepresentations"" that allowed her to fraudulently obtain loans, which she subsequently misused to finance a luxurious lifestyle, state investigators found.

The presentence report says that in addition to Head to Toe Therapy, O'Brien owned ""multiple limited liability companies, many of which received COVID-19 relief loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration."" The federal agency offered two programs at the time: Paycheck Protection Program, PPP, and Economic Injury Disaster Loan, EIDL.

The presentence report says that between March 31 and Jan. 12, 2021, businesses that O'Brien owned applied for four PPP loans and 19 EIDL loans."
https://abcnews.go.com/US/shohei-ohtani-interpreter-sentencing-gambling-fraud-case/story?id=118489045,2025-02-06T21:52:19Z,"Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for MLB star Shohei Ohtani, was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison on Thursday on charges related to stealing nearly $17 million from the Dodgers player. The sentence was handed down nearly a year after the gambling controversy first surfaced.

Mizuhara, 40, admitted to fraudulently transferring the money from Ohtani's account for more than two years to pay his gambling debts, including impersonating the athlete on two dozen occasions in calls to the bank, according to a plea agreement in the case.

The 57-month sentence was awarded for one count of bank fraud. On a second count, for subscribing to a false tax return, he was given 36 months -- to be served concurrently.

Prosecutors called the scheme ""deep"" and ""extensive"" fraud and that Ohtani was ""harmed substantially"" by Mizuhara's actions.

Mizuhara is free on $25,000 bond and is scheduled to surrender on March 24.

He was additionally sentenced to three years supervised release and ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution -- including nearly $17 million to Ohtani, more than $1 million to the IRS and court fines.

Mizuhara, a permanent resident of the U.S., also faces a risk of deportation back to his native Japan upon completion of the federal sentence, prosecutors said.

Joseph McNally, the acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said outside the courthouse in Santa Ana, California, following the hearing that the sentence reflects the ""seriousness of the offense and sends a strong message.""

He also emphasized the harm done to Ohtani, who submitted a victim impact statement to the court that has been sealed.

""In this case, he had money stolen from him. He was taken advantage of. He was preyed on by Mr. Mizuhara,"" McNally said. ""Mr. Mizuhara lied, he cheated and he stole. His behavior was shameless.""

Mizuhara made a brief statement in court ahead of his sentencing in which he apologized to Ohtani, the Dodgers, the judge and the government.

""I am not trying to justify my actions,"" he said. ""I am prepared to receive my punishment.""

His attorney, Michael Freedman, argued that Mizuhara was ""under a lot of financial stress"" when he stole from Ohtani. Judge John Holcomb, however, challenged the defense's portrayal of an underpaid worker, noting that Ohtani had given his former translator five-figure tips and a Porsche, and he had paid for all travel expenses for Mizuhara and his wife -- as well as most of their rent.

The judge also raised the fact that Mizuhara had more than $34,000 in his personal account when he took the first $40,000 from Ohtani to pay his first debt.

Mizuhara asks judge for mercy

In a three-page letter to Judge Holcomb filed ahead of the sentencing hearing, Mizuhara asked for a ""merciful and not punitive"" sentence and set out to explain why he committed the fraud.

He described mounting financial stresses that he said led him to use an online sports betting website run by Mathew Bowyer starting in 2021. He said that due to his ""ignorance to the gambling industry,"" he did not realize it was an illegal gambling business until early 2024.

""Being desperate for money at the time, I stupidly thought this might be an opportunity to help myself out financially and started to use his website for sports betting. And before I knew it, the results were the complete opposite,"" Mizuhara wrote. ""My gambling debt had grown so much that I could not find any way to pay it but to use Shohei's money. ... I felt terribly guilty about putting my hands on his money but this was the only solution I could think of at the time.""

Mizuhara also said that the offseason was ""physically and mentally"" harder while detailing some of his errands for Ohtani, such as driving him to trainings, taking his dog to the vet and fixing his bicycle -- saying he had ""almost no true days off.""

""I felt like I was getting severely underpaid but I was afraid to speak up for myself as I was on a one year contract every year and I didn't want to upset them and end up getting fired,"" he wrote.

Mizuhara said he hopes to use his experience to help others dealing with gambling problems. He also outlined the impact a prison sentence would have on his wife.

""I understand that I have made a decision that will impact my entire life and I am not making excuses for what I have done. I am not trying to justify my actions in any way. I am asking that you will look at me as a man and believe change can happen,"" he said. ""I don't believe an apology will fix my wrong. I am prepared [to] accept my consequences. I am asking for a little mercy from the court concerning my sentence you will hand down.""

He lastly said he is ""truly sorry"" for violating Ohtani's trust in him.

Defense, government make case for sentence

Mizuhara pleaded guilty last year to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum of 30 years in prison, and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, which carries up to three years in prison. A sentence of 48 months was recommended by the probation officer.

Mizuhara's attorney had asked the judge to impose an 18-month sentence, arguing in a memorandum that the interpreter was devoted to his work for Ohtani but suffers from a ""longstanding gambling addiction, which was uniquely exacerbated by his grueling work and exposure to high-stakes bookmakers in the world of professional athletes.""

Mizuhara ""made a terrible mistake as a result of his serious gambling addiction, an anomaly in an otherwise law-abiding life in which he was dedicated to his career as an interpreter for Mr. Ohtani and other baseball players,"" Freedman wrote.

The defense attorney also said Mizuhara's reputation here and in Japan has been ""irretrievably stained"" and that he ""will continue to suffer as a result of harm to his reputation and career in the global press and through certain deportation.""

Prosecutors, meanwhile, had asked the court to impose a prison sentence of 57 months while disputing what they called ""unsupported claims"" by the defense on the extent of Mizuhara's gambling problem and the financial problems he had said led him to Bowyer's illegal sports betting business.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Mitchell wrote in a response to the defense's sentencing filings that the government could find no proof of a long-standing gambling addiction, and that Mizuhara did not have ""such a 'tremendous debt' that it forced him to steal millions of dollars from Mr. Ohtani, as he claims.""

Mitchell also questioned whether Mizuhara is ""truly remorseful or whether they are just sorry they were caught"" and highlighted portions of Mizuhara's letter to the judge, in which he detailed his offseason duties for Ohtani.

""The government does not question defendant's work ethic, but only his characterization of the work and his true intention,"" Mitchell wrote. ""Instead of using this opportunity to apologize and show true remorse, he has used it, in a public filing, to complain about his work and Mr. Ohtani.""

In addition to the prison sentence, the government asked for three years of supervised release, restitution of $16,975,010 to Ohtani and $1,149,400 to the IRS.

Sentencing comes nearly year after firing

Mizuhara worked with the Angels as Ohtani's interpreter and then in the same capacity with the Dodgers, until the team fired him nearly a year ago, in March 2024, after the gambling controversy surfaced.

Ohtani addressed the scandal at the time during a press briefing, saying in a prepared statement through an interpreter, ""I am very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this.""

Mizuhara pleaded guilty to the federal charges in June 2024.

According to the plea agreement, from November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara transferred nearly $17 million from the account to associates of the bookmaker in more than 40 wires without Ohtani's permission.

Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers prior to last year, the richest deal in sports history.

Bowyer pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for running an illegal gambling business that took unlawful sports bets from hundreds of customers, including Mizuhara, the Department of Justice said. He is scheduled to be sentenced in April.

Mizuhara also admitted in the plea agreement to falsely claiming that his total taxable income for 2022 was $136,865 when, in fact, he failed to report an additional $4.1 million in income.

""The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank,"" the DOJ said, noting that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.

His sentencing was originally postponed several times after the defense asked for more time to prepare and for a forensic psychologist to complete a report about Mizuhara's gambling.

According to Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company recently filed a racketeering lawsuit that alleges a vast criminal conspiracy in which law firms, doctors, and pain management clinics teamed up to stage fake car accidents and resulting injuries in order to cash in on insurance payouts from Uber.

So here is Uber’s telling of the situation, as told by a filing submitted to the US District Court in the Eastern District of New York: Since 2019, a ring of legal and medical professionals in New York have been targeting people involved in car accidents. They grab people who have been in “purported or actual minor vehicle collisions,” making excessive claims as to the injuries they suffered in the wreck, and putting them through “medically unnecessary” and “invasive and painful” surgeries that Uber ultimately has to pay for. According to Uber, many of the medical conditions are “fictitious, exaggerated or that preexisted,” and some of the procedures to address those injuries are extreme, including “spinal fusions.”

New York State requires Uber and other ridesharing apps to maintain liability insurance on their drivers, which covers any injury that may occur to a driver or passenger as part of a ride hailed through the service. In New York City, regulations require drivers to maintain personal injury coverage, as well, for a minimum of $200,000. New York is a no-fault state, which means that insurance has to pay for coverage no matter who was “at fault” for an accident occurring—something that Uber claims these law firms and doctors were taking advantage of.

Uber is not the first company to raise the prospect of fraudulent insurance claims in New York. The American Transit Insurance Co. (ATIC), New York’s largest taxi insurer, filed a similar case last year that claimed medical providers had defrauded the company of $450 million. The lawsuit contains many of the same claims Uber made, that doctors are intentionally over-diagnosing, over-treating, and over-billing for injuries sustained from car accidents in order to cash in on the insurance policies.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, recently proposed several changes to how the insurance industry operates within the state, in no small part at the behest of ATIC as it faces major solvency issues. The proposals would include additional resources for looking into insurance fraud like the kind that both ATIC and Uber are alleging targets them."

The truck company will also be banned from exporting its diesel engines to the country for five years.

It comes after Hino was charged with fraud in a Detroit court for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US between 2010 and 2022.

The settlement still requires approval by a US court.

According to the US Justice Department, Hino submitted ""false and fraudulent"" emission testing and fuel consumption data in a ""criminal conspiracy"" that allowed it to import and sell its engines in the United States.

""Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom-line,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.

""To further this fraudulent scheme, Hino violated laws and regulations intended to protect American's health and the environment.""

On top of the five-year diesel engine import ban, Hino has also committed to a compliance and ethics plan during that period.

""We take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program, and further strengthening of our compliance system ... are implemented,"" said Satoshi Ogiso, Hino's chief executive and president in a statement.

""We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders.""

The US Environmental Protection Agency said Hino has also agreed to recall some infringing heavy-duty trucks and to replace marine and locomotive engines across the country to offset excess air emissions.

In order to cover costs resulting from its legal problems, Hino said that in its second quarter financial results announced in October, it reported an extraordinary loss of 230 billion yen (£1.2bn, $1.48bn).

In the last decade, several car makers admitted to lying about the emissions produced by their diesel engines.

In what has become known as the dieselgate scandal, brands throughout the Volkswagen corporate empire were implicated, including Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda as well as Volkswagen itself.

Volkswagen has spent more than 30 billion euros (£25bn, $30.9bn) paying fines, issuing recalls and compensating its customers."

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch told MPs: ""His budget means fewer jobs, lower growth and higher borrowing costs"", and she asked whether Chancellor Rachel Reeves was planning to raise taxes in a March mini-budget.

Defending his chancellor, the prime minister said the government's fiscal rules were ""iron clad"", and the government ""can't just tax and spend our way out of [the] problems"".

And he said Reeves would be chancellor for ""many, many years to come"".

Recent market turbulence has meant the cost of servicing UK debt has risen, and the last few days have seen pressures on the public finances increase, after government borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years.

Attacking the Conservatives as ""economic vandals and fantasists"", Sir Keir said his focus was on growth.

""They flatlined the economy and left us with the worst cost of living crisis in living history and a £22bn black hole, so I won't be taking lesson on the economy from them,"" he said.

Badenoch said the Office for Budget Responsibility ""found no such black hole"" and said two-thirds of businesses have complained they will need to raise prices as a result of Labour's first budget, which raised national insurance costs for employers.

""The prime minister claims he has full confidence in [Rachel Reeves] but the markets clearly do not,"" she said, adding: ""Labour congratulated themselves in having the first female chancellor, instead of ensuring they had somebody who was qualified for the job.""

The Conservative leader also highlighted that the PM has lost two ministers in as many months, with the resignation of city minister Tulip Siddiq, and the resignation of transport minister Louise Haigh at the end of November due to an historic fraud conviction.

Sir Keir dismissed Badenoch's insults as ""cheap political points"" and compared the resignations to the actions of the current Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, who remained in post as home secretary despite being found to have breached the ministerial code.

And he delivered his own barb at the Tories' former leader Liz Truss, who sent the PM a letter demanding Labour stop claiming she ""crashed the economy"" as it was damaging her reputation.

Sir Keir said: ""It wasn't written in green ink but it might as well have been.

""It was actually crashing the economy that damaged her reputation."""
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04nx1vnw17o,2025-02-07T10:01:23Z,"The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it.

Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.

It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.

But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.

The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.

She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.

But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.

Getting there is tricky.

Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.

As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.

She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – ""Mr She believes in making a green city,"" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.

At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.

Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. ""Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,"" they told us. And what about the businesses? ""Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.""

However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.

Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that ""online businesses"" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.

Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.

The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.

Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.

We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.

Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.

""The target is the elderly,"" she said. ""You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.""

Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.

""When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,"" she says. ""The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.""

During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.

Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border.

We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.

""I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,"" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held.

Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him.

Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind.

Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China.

This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas.

He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.

In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe.

Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (£12.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world.

China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar.

In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.

She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.

He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.

While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to ""a high probability"" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.

""Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.""

It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city.

It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here.

With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly.

Yatai's strategy is ""to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city"", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko.

He says they may even ""begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones"".

But he doesn't think the plan will work: ""What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.""

When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down.

Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty.

The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around.

The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.

It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us – not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said.

The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them.

We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty.

The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam.

They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there.

They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down.

Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.

In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young protégé, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.

Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. ""We are just property developers,"" he said. ""I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here.

""But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.""

But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border.

Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.

Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.

It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.

Neither do recent headlines.

Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him.

Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed.

The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko.

Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said.

They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth.

That distinction hasn't helped She Zhijiang, who once had the ear of politicians, police bosses and even minor royalty in Thailand. Today he appears to have lost even the influence he once had in prison, to buy himself special privileges. He has complained of being roughed up by the guards.

His lawyers are appealing against the Interpol red notice used to justify his arrest, but China's voice will probably be loudest in determining his fate.

From our interview with him, Shi Zhijiang seemed genuinely outraged over his sudden reversal of fortune.

""Before, I had no understanding of human rights, but now I really understand how horrible it is to have human rights infringed upon,"" he said.

""It is hard to imagine how the human rights of ordinary people in China are trampled upon when a respected businessman like me, who used to be able to go to the same state banquets as Xi Jinping, does not have his human rights and dignity protected in any way.""

It seems he really did believe he could build something which would one day transcend Shwe Kokko's sordid origins as a scam city.

What happens to it now is hard to guess, but if the Thai and Chinese governments keep acting to shut down the scams, the money will start to dry up."
https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268986/trump-humanitarian-parole-immigration,2025-01-21T04:48:35Z,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is slashing a program that was used by the Biden administration to temporarily allow the entrance of more than half a million migrants fleeing Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

In an executive order signed Monday evening, Trump instructed the Department of Homeland Security to ""terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders,"" including the humanitarian parole program for those four countries.

""One of my most important obligations is to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement,"" Trump said in the order. ""My Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to stop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States.""

Nearly 30,000 migrants had been granted the temporary stay each month since January 2023.

It's unclear what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people currently living with humanitarian parole.

The Biden administration paused the program due to fraud concerns. In October, it decided not to renew the legal status of those under the program, saying migrants would have to find a different path for legal status once their parole expires.

Biden's initiative allowed migrants from those embattled countries to apply for entry from their countries due to ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,"" without having to attempt to cross illegally outside a port of entry. A U.S.-based sponsor and a background check were required to apply.

Once approved, migrants were allowed to stay in the country for up to two years, get a work permit and be shielded from deportations.

Since 2023, 531,690 people have been granted humanitarian parole, according to DHS. The majority have come from Haiti.

The program has been credited with helping to reduce the number of unlawful crossings by migrants from those countries at the U.S.-Mexico border."
https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/four_plead_guilty_in_us/,2025-01-15T12:36:24Z,"Four defendants have pleaded guilty in a US government IT procurement fraud case, which prosecutors claim has cost taxpayers at least $1.3 million in losses.

In the District of Maryland, a government official and an IT contractor were among those who admitted to charges relating to their roles in bid-rigging schemes. These involved bribery connected with the sale of IT products and services to the federal government, including the Department of Defense (DoD).

In November last year, government tech contractor Brandon Scott Glisson and federal official Lawrence Eady [PDF] pleaded guilty to separate counts of bribery. Prosecutors said Glisson bribed Eady with $630,000 from his company, Alpha Greatness Omega (AGO) in exchange for a promise that the US government would purchase IT products from one of their co-conspirators' companies at artificially inflated, non-competitive prices. According to the US Justice department, the scheme ran between August 2019 and October 2020. The inflated chunk of the price was then paid to AGO, which Glisson used for personal luxury purchases and to fund the bribes, prosecutors said.

Among the first guilty pleas in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into IT manufacturers, distributors and resellers selling to US government included that of Antwann Rawls, an on-site government IT consultant, and Scott Reefe, an IT sales executive.

Earlier this month, Reefe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while Rawls pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States.

Prosecutors allege that between 2018 and May 2019 (at a minimum), Rawls, Reefe, and others involved attained confidential procurement information, including procurement budgets for large US government IT contracts. They then used inside information to rig bids for government IT contracts at artificially determined, non-competitive and non-independent prices, ensuring one of their co-conspirators’ companies would win the contracts, the complaint alleges. Government estimates suggest that the cost to the US public purse was at least $1,300,000 in losses.

In a statement, acting assistant attorney general Doha Mekki of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said: ""These convictions bring to justice individuals who cheated and defrauded the United States government for their own personal gain. Holding these individuals accountable shows that rigging bids for government contracts will not go unnoticed or unpunished.""

Christopher Dillard, the special agent in charge of a DoD Defense Criminal Investigative Service, said the ""outcome demonstrates our commitment to aggressively investigate those who enrich themselves with federal procurement dollars while cheating taxpayers. DCIS is proud to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the procurement process, including when it impacts the intelligence community.""

Sentencing hearings are due to be set at a later date. Those pleading guilty face anything between five and 20 years in prison.

In October last year, six individuals were indicted in charges relating to procurement fraud. As well as those now pleading guilty, Victor Marquez, owner of two IT companies with significant government contracts, and Breal Madison Jr, a fellow Maryland resident, were also indicted.

The allegations against Madison suggest the US government could have been defrauded of $7 million in connection with the sale of IT products to various government agencies. ®"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c805lpz35n1o,2025-01-14T02:57:00Z,"The special prosecutor who led a years-long investigation into Joe Biden's son, Hunter, has criticised the president for making ""baseless accusations"" about the case and defended his investigation in a final report.

In the report, released Monday, David Weiss called his prosecution of the president's son on gun and tax crimes ""impartial"" and ""not partisan politics"".

Hunter Biden's lawyer said the report showed Mr Weiss's investigation ""was a cautionary tale of the abuse of prosecutorial power.""

Biden issued an official pardon for his son, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, in early December.

While issuing the pardon, the president said his son had been ""singled out"" and called his cases ""a miscarriage of justice"" and ""raw politics"".

Mr Weiss called those statements ""gratuitous and wrong"".

""I prosecuted the two cases against [Hunter] Biden because he broke the law,"" he wrote in his report.

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June.

His father's full and unconditional pardon for his son came after the president had repeatedly said he would not give him clemency.

It was not the first time a US president has pardoned a family member.

Bill Clinton pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a 1985 cocaine-related offence in 2001.

In 2020, Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter, Ivanka, who pled guilty to federal charges of tax evasion and illegal campaign donation payments in 2005.

In his report, Mr Weiss acknowledged that, but added: ""none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations"".

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine counts of federal tax fraud in September, for which he had been facing up to 17 years in prison.

He was also convicted of three felonies in connection with a gun purchase in June, for which he had been facing up to 25 years in prison.

The investigations into the president's son had resurfaced uncomfortable and embarrassing details about his personal life, including his addiction to crack-cocaine and alleged payments to escorts.

President Biden had mostly kept quiet during the investigations into his son but came fiercely to his defence in his pardoning.

""There has been an effort to break Hunter - who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,"" President Biden said.

""In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me - and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""

He added: ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.""

The pardon covers the period from 1 January 2014 to 1 December 2024, ""including but not limited to"" the tax and gun crimes for which he was found guilty.

Mr Weiss said due to that unconditional pardon, he could not make any ""additional charging decisions"" relating to Hunter Biden over that period.

""It would be inappropriate to discuss whether additional charges are warranted,"" he said.

Mr Weiss has previously defended his inquiry into the president's son.

In 2023, he told the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee there had never been political pressure or interference in his work from the justice department.

Mr Weiss's investigation into Hunter Biden was heavily scrutinised on both sides of the political spectrum.

Democrats said it was politically charged and felt that Hunter Biden had an unfair target on his back.

Republicans believed the justice department was not pursuing charges aggressively enough and showing the president's son unfair favouritism.

Hunter Biden's guilty convictions came after a collapsed plea deal in 2023.

A judge declined to approve the deal - which Republicans had branded a ""sweetheart deal"" - that would have had Hunter Biden plead guilty to the tax evasion charges to avoid the more serious gun-related charges.

In a statement released Monday, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, criticised Mr Weiss for the failed deal.

""Mr. Weiss also fails to explain why he reneged on his own agreement, a reversal that came at the 11th hour in court as he and his office faced blistering attacks from Republicans,"" Mr Lowell said."

https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/43721275/mizuhara-sentenced-57-months-prison-ohtani-fraud,2025-02-06T22:47:18Z,"SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Ippei Mizuhara was sentenced Thursday to nearly five years in prison for stealing about $17 million from Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani to repay gambling debts.

U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb gave Ohtani's former interpreter a 57-month sentence and three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay nearly $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS.

""I want to say I am truly sorry to Mr. Ohtani for what I have done,"" Mizuhara, 40, said in court.

Mizuhara was ordered to surrender to authorities to begin serving his sentence by March 24. His attorney, Michael G. Freedman, said he expects Mizuhara, a Japanese citizen, to be deported at a later date.

""The magnitude of the theft -- $17 million -- in my view, is shockingly high,"" Holcomb said upon issuing the sentence.

Holcomb said most people don't make that much money in their lifetime.

""I hope that Mr. Mizuhara will be able to repay that sum,"" Holcomb said. ""That remains to be seen.""

Ohtani's attorneys and spokesperson did not respond to ESPN's request for comment.

The Dodgers fired Mizuhara in March after an ESPN investigation revealed that he had sent millions in wire transfers from Ohtani's account to an illegal bookmaker. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return in June, admitting that he placed about 19,000 bets with the bookie over a two-year period and accumulated over $40 million in debt.

""Mr. Mizuhara had a unique position of trust that gave him power, brought him fame, and paid him well,"" Joseph T. McNally, acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California, said in a news release. ""Unfortunately, he exploited this dream job to steal millions of dollars from his friend and confidant. This is a sad tale of an American success story gone wrong -- so wrong that Mr. Mizuhara will be spending years inside a prison cell.""

After the hearing, McNally said outside the courthouse that Ohtani is the victim in this case.

Prosecutors recommended a 57-month sentence, while Mizuhara's lawyer asked for an 18-month sentence, citing a long-standing gambling addiction. But in a court filing, prosecutors said there was ""only minimal evidence"" that Mizuhara had gambled before he began stealing from Ohtani.

""Mr. Mizuhara's addiction was drastic,"" Freedman said in court. ""Astronomical sums were involved.""

Freedman said Mizuhara's gambling addiction was ""inflamed"" because of the huge amount of credit the bookie gave him, knowing Mizuhara worked for Ohtani.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Mitchell told the court that when Mizuhara began stealing from Ohtani in 2021, the Japanese superstar earned $250,000 at the Los Angeles Angels.

""Mizuhara stole almost half of everything Ohtani made with the Angels,"" Mitchell said.

Two North Korean nationals residing in China, Jin Sung-Il and Pak Jin-Song, are among the indicted, accused of carrying out various jobs for numerous US companies, all facilitated by three others running so-called laptop farms.

Mexican national Pedro Ernesto Alonso De Los Reyes, who lives in Sweden, and US nationals Erick Ntekereze Prince and Emanuel Ashtor, of New York and North Carolina respectively, were also charged for facilitating the scheme.

Alonso is accused of willfully allowing the North Korean devs to use his genuine identity to create fake US worker visa documents, while Prince and Ashtor are alleged to have registered and run Taggcar and Vali Tech respectively – two US staffing companies used to secure employment for remote contractors.

Prosecutors claim the scheme ran for quite some time. The indictment [PDF] alleges that all five individuals, along with others not included in the charges, started the scheme as early as April 2018 and ran it until around August 2024.

The US claims Prince and Ashtor set up the laptops issued by the victimized US companies and unlawfully downloaded remote access software like AnyDesk and Teamviewer, allegedly allowing the likes of Jin, Pak, and others to remotely connect to and work for the US companies in IT roles. These were mainly mobile app developer gigs, but also involved what the indictment describes as ""specialist engineer positions.""

Unspecified members of the scheme also established US bank accounts to receive payments from salaries, which in some cases were well in excess of six figures, as well as accounts at other payment platforms used to launder the funds, minus the share allegedly taken by Alonso and Prince, the DoJ claims.

At least 64 US companies were successfully fooled by the scheme over the six-year period, the indictment states. Payments made by just ten of these orgs totaled approximately $866,255.

Only nine of the victim companies were described in any detail:

One is a multinational retail corporation based in the US

Another was a financial institution based in Stamford, CT

A Miami-based international cruise line

A San Francisco tech biz

Two IT companies based in Palo Alto and Milpitas, CA

Three staffing companies based in Illinois, California, and Florida

These companies were victimized in different ways, sometimes simultaneously. In one example shared in the indictment, Jin allegedly secured employment at the Illinois staffing company and signed documents with the Palo Alto IT company regarding confidentiality and care for the company-issued device.

Another saw Jin allegedly secure employment at the Stamford financial institution and, months later, a second job at the San Francisco tech company. After securing the job in Stamford, Jin informed the company he changed his family name to ""Bane,"" the persona he then used to secure a job in San Francisco, according to the indictment.

""The Department of Justice remains committed to disrupting North Korea's cyber-enabled sanctions-evading schemes, which seek to trick US companies into funding the North Korean regime's priorities, including its weapons programs,"" said Devin DeBacker, supervisory official at the Justice Department's National Security Division.

""Our commitment includes the vigorous pursuit of both the North Korean actors and those providing them with material support. It also includes standing side-by-side with US companies to not only disrupt ongoing victimization, but also to help them independently detect and prevent such schemes in the future.""

Prince and Ashtor were both arrested by the FBI at an unspecified time. Ashtor's residence in North Carolina was searched and law enforcement officials said it was previously used to host the laptop farm.

Alonso was also arrested earlier this month, on January 10 in the Netherlands, following an arrest warrant issued by the US. There was no word mentioned of whether he had yet been extradited.

All five individuals are charged and face counts related to conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to transfer false identification documents.

Additionally, Jin and Pak are charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Being based in China, the likelihood of them being seen in a US courthouse is slim, although if by chance that does happen, they'll face a maximum sentence of 20 years.

FBI hunts better, North Korea gets nastier

Coinciding with the Thursday indictment, the FBI updated its previous guidance on North Korean IT worker tradecraft, saying the fraudsters' tactics have become more aggressive of late.

After securing employment, the FBI said these workers were caught stealing proprietary data, including code, and extorting the employer for a ransom payment. Some cases have led to this data being published online, it added.

While it's not uncommon for software developers to copy company code to their personal GitHub accounts, the practice is seen as a major risk in the case of the North Korean schemes.

There are growing fears that these workers could take their tradecraft further, stealing genuine credentials and session cookies to facilitate additional types of compromise.

Commenting on the news, Michael Barnhart, principal analyst at Mandiant, said: ""The increased pressure from law enforcement and media coverage on North Korea's elaborate IT worker scheme is impacting the success of their operations. However, an unfortunate byproduct of law enforcement action is these threat actors are becoming noticeably more aggressive in their tactics.

""We are increasingly seeing North Korean IT workers infiltrating larger organizations to steal sensitive data and follow through on their extortion threats against these enterprises. It's also unsurprising to see them expanding their operations into Europe to replicate their success, as it's easier to entrap citizens who aren't familiar with their ploy.""

Barnhart also said Mandiant, which previously shared its top tips on catching North Korean IT miscreants, is seeing a rise in them specifically targeting companies that rely on virtual desktop infrastructure instead of providing their remote employees with physical hardware.

While it's more cost-effective for companies, and eliminates the need for laptop farms, ""it's easier for the threat actors to hide their malicious activity,"" he said.

https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/03/two_psni_officers_arrested_bailed/,2025-02-03T11:46:06Z,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has bailed two officers after they were arrested as part of a fraud investigation related to the payments to cops whose sensitive data was mistakenly published in 2023.

The personal data of 9,483 officers and staff members was exposed online for two hours in August 2023 following a botched response to a Freedom of Information request made by a member of the public. All of the 9,483 officers were offered £500 ($615) to be spent on shoring up their own personal security out of fear for their safety. Around 90 percent of these offers were accepted.

Police's data is considered especially sensitive in Northern Ireland, where many officers never reveal their job or role, even to family members, because of the tension with local Irish nationalists who do not believe the region should be under British control.

The PSNI's Anti-Corruption Unit is now looking into fraudulent activity related to those payments made to officers. The service didn't respond to The Register's request for more details about what that fraud entailed.

Bobby Singleton, deputy chief constable at the PSNI, said in a statement: ""The August 2023 data breach had a significant impact on many of our officers, staff, and their families.

""From the outset, we sought to provide them with the best possible support. The 'universal offer' of £500 per officer/staff member was intended to allow officers and staff to take practical steps to provide security and reassurance to them and their families. Ninety percent of officers and staff took up this offer of financial support.

""Following an investigation by our Anti-Corruption Unit on January 29, 2025, two officers have been arrested, interviewed, and bailed for fraud offenses relating to the universal offer.

""Concurrent misconduct investigations have also commenced and the duty status of both officers is, in line with police regulations, now being considered.

""The public rightly expect and demand the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all of our police officers and staff.

""When the actions of individuals are suspected to fall short of these standards, it seriously undermines legitimacy, trust, and public confidence in policing.

""In these cases, we will always seek to move swiftly and ensure an effective investigation to restore and maintain public confidence.

""As there is an ongoing investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.""

Commissioner Pete O'Doherty of the City of London Police previously described PSNI's data protection flub as ""the most significant data breach that has ever occurred in the history of UK policing.""

A review of the incident was published three months later, revealing an undisclosed number of PSNI officers had to relocate out of safety fears, while many more wanted to but didn't have the financial means to do so. The PSNI originally said that no officers were being relocated.

Some police officers even sought help from the service to legally change their names, although the review noted the PSNI told these officers they were taking an unnecessary step.

Why relocate?

The actions taken by some officers in the wake of the data's publication may seem extreme to someone without an understanding of the region's politics.

For decades in the 1900s, Northern Ireland was marred by ethno-nationalist conflict that was eventually ended, largely, by the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The history still lives fresh in the memory of the country's citizens, however, and periodic violence is still observed in modern times.

Many of the officers and staff whose data was published didn't take such drastic action, although the PSNI's health and well-being services were acutely affected.

The December 2023 review noted at the time that these services were stretched and there was a force-wide decline in mental health. More than 50 sickness absences were also directly linked to the botched FoI, with staff saying they had withdrawn from their social lives, and were scared to see family and friends."

15 January 2025

Matt Precey

BBC News, Northamptonshire

Five men have been charged with fraud related to a multimillion-pound loan to a League One football club.

The former chairman of Northampton Town FC, David Cardoza, is accused alongside his father Anthony, property developer Howard Grossman and his son Marcus and another man, Simon Patnick.

It follows a nine-year police investigation into the apparent disappearance of more than £10m loaned to the club by the then Northampton Borough Council.

The five are due to appear at Northampton Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

The men face fifteen charges between them:

Anthony Cardoza, 80, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, is accused of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position.

David Cardoza, 54, from Eastbourne, Sussex, is accused of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation, fraud by abuse of position and transferring criminal property.

Howard Grossman, 63, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, has been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation alongside four counts of removing criminal property and a charge of acquiring criminal property.

Marcus Grossman, 37, from London, is alleged to have committed fraud by false representation and transferred criminal property.

Simon Patnick, 54, from Stanmore, London, has also been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and acquiring criminal property.

Each man is accused of conspiring to make false representations to the council that the loan money would be used for the sole purpose of developing Northampton Town FC's Sixfields Stadium and an adjoining hotel.

It is alleged they knew this was ""untrue or misleading"" and that the men were ""intending to make a gain for themselves"", the charges state.

David and Anthony Cardoza have also been charged with fraud by abuse of position, which relates to a sum of £8.75m being paid from the football club to 1st Land Limited, a company owned by Howard Grossman.

It is more than nine years since Northamptonshire Police began Operation Tuckhill - its investigation into the apparent disappearance of the loan money, which was passed on to the club in order to develop a new stand and a hotel.

The East Stand remained half built for 10 years and is only now being completed.

The force said the alleged theft from Northampton Borough Council was only one element of a much wider investigation which has, over the past nine years, ""seen almost 1,000 witness statements taken and 4,719 exhibits logged by the specialist team set up in the wake of the initial police raids on the football stadium in November 2015"".

In a statement, Northampton Town FC acknowledged ""the recent statement from Northamptonshire Police regarding the previous owners of the club back in 2015"".

It continued: ""The club were always aware of the ongoing investigation and - in terms of the club now - it is obviously historic in nature.""

The 53-year-old victim, who gave her name as Anne, forked out 830,000 euros ($851,355) to help with what she believed was cancer treatment for the Hollywood legend.

A scammer managed to do so by convincing Anne they were Brad Pitt with a series of AI-generated images.

Greg Gutfeld's Fox News return date finally revealed after hiatus due to new arrival

The interior designer told French channel TF1 that the ordeal started when she received a message on social media from someone claiming to be Brad's mother after sharing photos of her fancy ski trip to Tignes on Instagram.

A day later, another account posing as the Hollywood heartthrob sent a second message, saying his mother had spoken a lot about her already.

The victim, who noted she was going through a difficult period with her millionaire husband, said she struck up an unlikely friendship with the account from February 2023, receiving poems and sweet affirmations.

""There are so few men who write you this kind of thing. I liked the man I was talking to. He knew how to talk to women, it was always very well done,"" she said, as reported by BFMTV.

While Anne admitted she did have her suspicions that the account was fake, after messaging every day and receiving AI-generated photos and videos of the star, she became more at ease.

Soon Anne's online relationship with 'Bad Pitt' went to the next level when the person behind the account proposed to her and overwhelmed her with the promise of fancy gifts.

The only catch was that she would need to pay customs fees to receive them, which quickly added up to 9,000 euros ($9231).

With Anne already showing a willingness to part with large sums of money, the scammer went on to make increasingly absurd requests.

When the victim told 'Bad Pitt' that she was expecting a hefty divorce settlement from her husband, the scammer saw this as the perfect opportunity to up the ante with their requests.

The Brad Pitt account went on to appeal for help in funding urgent kidney cancer treatment, claiming that they could not access funds due to their ongoing divorce from Angelina Jolie.

The scammer reportedly then began sending AI-generated photos of the World War X star from the confines of a hospital bed.

Anne pointed out that while she and the scammer communicated by text and with photos, she said he was never free for a call - a common motif among online scammers.

In the end, she parted ways with nearly one million euros throughout the relationship until her suspicions were confirmed when she saw pics of the actor with his new girlfriend, Ines de Ramon.

Anne went to the authorities with the story, who launched an investigation.

It was unclear whether she had been able to recoup any of her money nearly two years since the relationship began.

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in ""immense distress and pain"".

Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode.

After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud.

""[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,"" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday.

Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval.

She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house.

Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing ""severe emotional and physical distress and harm"". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said.

However, Insp Dalton said the child was now ""safe and doing well"".

The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said.

Police had investigated other people over the alleged abuse, but there was no evidence to charge anyone else, he added.

The woman is due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday."

But one Washington pastor decided his own church flock was an appropriate place to start fleecing, according to the US Department of Justice.

The DoJ has charged Francier Obando Pinillo, the former pastor of a church in Pasco, Washington state, with 26 counts of fraud. So says an official press release issued last week and spotted by Bleeping Computer. According to the assistant district attorneys charging Pinillo, he sold his “Solano Fi” cryptocurrency to his parishioners both in person and on social media from 2021 to 2023, promising them a 34.9 percent return on investment with “no risk whatsoever.”

Pinillo allegedly claimed that the idea for the cryptocurrency “had come to him in a dream,” but funneled the investments into his own accounts and those of his co-conspirators, while showing his victims fake balances and returns via a mobile investment app. The DoJ alleges that victims were told to share the investment scam with others, and when suspicions of foul play were raised, Pinillo offered to “repair” the technical systems with more money or buy out their positions by replacing them with another investor.

Pinillo is charged with defrauding over a thousand victims both inside his own church and elsewhere of 5.9 million dollars. If convicted he could serve up to 20 years in prison.

https://qz.com/toyota-hino-motors-engine-emissions-fraud-scandal-1851740925,2025-01-16T14:35:00Z,"In This Story

Hino Motors (TM+0.56%), a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, has agreed to plead guilty and pay over $1.6 billion as part of a settlement with several U.S. agencies over an emissions fraud scheme.

The Japanese automaker was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud in U.S. federal court in Detroit for unlawfully selling more than 105,000 heavy-duty diesel engines into the U.S. between 2010 and 2022 that failed to meet emission standards, according to court documents. It made about $1.087 billion from its actions.

The misconduct first came to light in March 2022, when employees were revealed to have tampered with test results on engines used in more than 643,000 vehicles, including tens of thousands subject to a recall. Toyota removed Hino from a major Japanese truck consortium, and four officials, including three executives overseeing production and compliance, resigned.

A committee commissioned to investigate the scandal blamed it on an environment in which workers were forced to meet a strict pace of work and engineers felt they couldn’t challenge their bosses. A poor work environment was also found at Toyota’s Daihatsu subsidiary as part of an investigation into its recent safety scandal that tormented the Japanese auto industry last year.

“Hino’s actions led to vast amounts of excess air pollution and were an egregious violation of our nation’s environmental, consumer protection and import laws,” Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim said in a statement.

As part of its agreement to resolve multiple civil and criminal allegations, Hino agreed to plead guilty to engaging in a multi-year conspiracy and serve a five-year probation, during which it will be prevented from importing diesel engines into the U.S. The deal is awaiting approval by a federal judge in Michigan.

Hino ran afoul of several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the FBI, and the Department of Transportation, along with the state of California. The settlement includes a criminal penalty of $521.76 million, $442.5 million in civil penalties, and $236.5 million to resolve claims brought by California.

In October, Hino booked a loss $230 billion yen, or about $1.54 billion, to cover the expected costs.

“This resolution is a significant milestone toward resolving legacy issues that we have worked hard to ensure are no longer a part of Hino’s operations or culture,” Hino CEO Satoshi Ogiso said in a statement, adding that the automaker has enacted several company-wide reforms to prevent future misconduct.

“We commit to moving forward as a company that can be of service to society,” Ogiso said."

Joey Grant Luther, 54, was charged with wire fraud, smuggling, and other crimes related to the purchase and import of misbranded and counterfeit drugs at his medical spa, JGL Aesthetics, located in New York City's Hell's Kitchen. None of the Botox was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, prosecutors said.

""As alleged, Joey Grant Luther, who does not possess the licensing required by New York State to perform injections of Botox, knowingly purchased counterfeit Botox from China, injected it into his clients, and represented that the counterfeit Botox that he was peddling was genuine,"" U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said in a statement.

Luther allegedly continued to purchase and inject the counterfeit Botox despite knowing clients had fallen ill or experienced strange symptoms, Sassoon said. He allegedly reassured his patients that any side effects were temporary and that the Botox was from Allergan, the veritable maker, according to prosecutors.

""Luther's disregard for the health of his clients put all of his victims in harm's way and, in some cases, caused life-threating injuries,"" Sassoon said.

According to the criminal complaint, an investigation began after one of Luther's patients said they experienced double vision, heart palpitations, weakness from the waist up and other problems after receiving a Botox injection from JGL Aesthetics. The victim visited three hospitals to treat the symptoms and was diagnosed with Botulism toxin in March 2024, prosecutors said.

Customs and Border Protection intercepted parcels intended for JGL Aesthetics, finding one that contained ""significant quantities of counterfeit drugs, including counterfeit Botox,"" according to prosecutors.

Luther was scheduled to be presented late Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Cave. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.

It is unclear if Luther has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.

The case comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, alongside the FDA, opened an investigation last year after 19 people across nine states experienced negative side effects after receiving counterfeit Botox injections."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2025/01/28/customers-pay-the-price-of-policy-abuse-the-state-of-ecommerce-fraud/,2025-01-28T15:00:00Z,"Lax return policies and lenient fraud prevention measures are fueling a surge in ecommerce fraud, ultimately burdening consumers with higher prices and diminished trust in online shopping.

Ecommerce has transformed the shopping experience, turning living rooms into fitting rooms and checkout counters into a few clicks. But with this convenience comes a cost, and not just for retailers. On average, retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales in 2024 will be returned, and total returns for the retail industry are projected to reach $890 billion in 2024. Fraudulent and abusive practices surrounding returns, refunds, and exchanges now amount to a staggering $394 billion annual expense for retailers globally. Of this, at least $28 billion is lost directly to fraud and abuse, an issue becoming ever more sophisticated, according to a new report from Riskified titled “Returns, Refunds & Exchanges: Global Insights & Policy Playbook 2024.”

The real kicker? Honest customers are paying the price. Retailers are tightening once-generous policies to curb losses, leaving both legitimate and fraudulent shoppers feeling the pinch.

The Monster Merchants Created

The ecommerce boom of the pandemic era was a perfect storm of generosity. Retailers, in a bid to win over hesitant online shoppers, rolled out the red carpet: free returns, instant refunds, and no-questions-asked exchanges. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey found that at least 50% of demographics, including Americans over 18, Millennials, Gen-X, and Boomers find flexible return policies very important.

While this approach fostered customer loyalty, it also opened a kind of retailer Pandora's box. Fraudsters and policy abusers quickly identified opportunities to exploit loopholes faster than retailers could address them.

Indeed, the sophistication of abuse has skyrocketed. Riskified’s report says that more than 84% of merchants admit identifying fraudulent activity has become harder, while 76% say policy abuse is growing increasingly sophisticated.

What makes this problem particularly insidious is the advanced technological tools now available to fraudsters. ""Generosity is a double-edged sword in ecommerce,"" says Eido Gal, CEO of Riskified. ""What makes for a great customer experience also provides opportunities for fraudsters Factors like the Dark Web and malicious AI tools have turned return fraud into a highly efficient operation.""

Forums on the Dark Web offer “Fraud-as-a-Service” kits, while malicious AI tools like WormGPT automate scams that previously required manual effort. These tools empower even novice fraudsters to exploit systems with precision.

""Fraudsters are no longer operating in isolation. They exchange strategies and adjust in real time, making it incredibly challenging for retailers to stay ahead,"" says Gal.

Good Customers Are Paying the Price

It’s easy to dismiss this as a retailer problem, but the truth is, everyone bears the cost. Fraudsters steal more than products—they siphon away resources that could improve customer experiences. Worse still, peak shopping seasons see an uptick in fraudulent activity, as consumers overlook small, fraudulent charges on their credit cards amidst holiday spending.

Surprisingly, even middle-aged, middle-class shoppers—far from the archetype of a fraudster—are complicit. According to Riskified, these individuals justify policy abuse as a victimless crime, citing financial pressures and an ""everyone's doing it"" mentality.

Gal points out the far-reaching consequences: ""This normalization of abuse erodes trust between merchants and consumers. It forces retailers to implement stricter measures, which ultimately penalize honest shoppers.""

Underlining all of this is the simple fact that policy abuse is inherently tricky to identify. Fraudulent claims often resemble legitimate ones, forcing merchants to sift through vast amounts of data. The internal complexity—spanning customer service, logistics, and finance—further complicates the task. According to a Riskified report, 67% of merchants struggle with inadequate collaboration between departments, leading to silos that fraudsters are quick to exploit.

The End of Generous Policies

Retailers are shifting away from the “generous at all costs” philosophy and adopting a more pragmatic approach to safeguarding profits. Policies are shifting rapidly, as Riskified’s findings reveal. One-third of retailers now impose fees for returns, a move designed to offset the financial drain of reverse logistics. This may be forcing nearly 70% of all demographics to attempt in-store returns, according to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey

Similarly, another third of merchants have replaced refunds with store credit or exchange-only policies to retain revenue within their ecosystem. Additionally, two in five online retailers have significantly reduced their refund window to just seven days, a stark contrast to the 30-day standard still common in physical stores, underscoring the industry’s efforts to tighten operational controls.

While these changes help curb abuse, they also risk alienating loyal customers. “Striking the balance between security and service is the crux of this challenge,” Gal notes. “Retailers must protect their bottom line without undermining customer trust.”

Fighting Back: The Identity-Based Approach

For retailers to regain control, they must adopt more sophisticated, identity-driven strategies. By analyzing the individual behind each transaction, merchants can differentiate between loyal customers, occasional abusers, and outright fraudsters. This nuanced approach enables businesses to mitigate losses without alienating their best customers.

Riskified advocates several measures to help retailers combat policy abuse effectively while maintaining strong customer relationships. Leveraging AI and automation enables businesses to identify patterns of abuse and streamline decision-making processes with greater precision. Enhancing data transparency by breaking down silos between departments ensures that customer insights are shared effectively, enabling a more cohesive approach to fraud prevention.

Implementing tailored policies, such as sliding-scale return options based on customer loyalty and purchase history, strikes a balance between protecting profits and rewarding loyal customers.

Finally, focusing resources on customer service excellence enables retailers to deliver standout experiences to their ideal customers while addressing instances of fraud discreetly and efficiently.

This approach, as Gal emphasizes, is about creating a win-win: ""We’re not just fighting fraud. We’re optimizing customer experiences. Merchants who master this balance will thrive in an increasingly competitive market.""

Toward a Sustainable Ecommerce Ecosystem

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Returns, refunds, and exchanges account for nearly 11% of global ecommerce revenue. Beyond the financial impact, unchecked policy abuse undermines trust—a cornerstone of customer loyalty. Gal emphasizes, “Fraud prevention isn’t just about minimizing losses; it’s about safeguarding the brand’s relationship with its customers.”

By leveraging technology and identity-driven strategies, retailers can outsmart fraudsters without compromising the customer experience. As Riskified’s research shows, the key to success is strategic, data-driven action. Only then can merchants transform policy abuse from a costly challenge into an opportunity to build stronger, more resilient customer relationships."
https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/02/eurocops_takedown_cybercrime/,2025-02-02T13:19:07Z,"Law enforcement officers across Europe assembled again to collectively disrupt major facilitators of cybercrime, with at least one of those cuffed apparently a fan of the dramedy series The Gilmore Girls.

Two crime forums, Cracked and Nulled, were pulled offline.

Together, the platforms amassed more than 9 million users and were often budding e-miscreants' first foray into pursuing a life of cybercrime.

Similar to BreachForums, which was briefly taken down by law enforcement last year, Cracked and Nulled offered users a platform to discuss all things devious and a marketplace to sell their tools and ill-gotten wares.

The collective takedown action was led by German authorities in a campaign dubbed Operation Talent and took place between January 28-30.

It led to two arrests following the search of seven properties. Law enforcement seized 17 servers, 12 domains, 50 devices, and around €300,000 ($311,279) worth of cash and cryptocurrency tokens. Given that Cracked and Nulled generated millions in revenue, the amount seized is just a fraction - but still a notable disruption to their operations.

Lucas Sohn, a 29-year-old Argentine, was the only named suspect. A video released by Europol showed Sohn, who resides in Spain, being arrested and his devices combed through by the Guardia Civil. The video also showed the arrest of a second, unnamed individual.

It's not known whether the pair were complicit in running the services taken down by the police, although the video, which showed glimpses of their living quarters, showed two desks situated next to each other in a room decorated with various merchandise such as Pop figures, anime art, and TV show posters including one depicting the fictional town of Stars Hollow where the Gilmore Girls series is set.

According to the US Justice Department, Sohn is being linked to the administration of Nulled – a platform used to sell login credentials, stolen identity documents, and various tools used for cybercrime and fraud. The platform has been in operation since 2016, has 5 million registered users, and is estimated to generate $1 million in annual revenue.

""According to the complaint, Sohn was an active administrator of Nulled and performed escrow functions on the website,"" said the Justice Department.

""Nulled's customers would use Sohn's services to complete transactions involving stolen credentials and other information.""

Sohn faces three charges in the US related to conspiracy to traffic in passwords, access device fraud, and identity fraud, which carry maximum possible sentences of five, ten, and 15 years respectively.

The Justice Department said Cracked had been on the scene since 2018 and raked in $4 million in the process. Its primary offering was a marketplace that offered access to stolen credentials, hacking tools, and servers to host malware and stolen data.

It added that around 17 million people from the US were victimized by the activity that took place on Cracked, citing a specific case from New York where a woman was cyber-stalked and sextorted.

The alleged criminal behind this campaign used a product advertised on Cracked that purportedly offered access to ""billions of leaked websites,"" allowing users to search for stolen login credentials, including the New York woman's.

Eight of Cracked's domains were seized and in doing so, investigators also found details of the site's payment processor, Sellix, and the StarkRDP bulletproof hosting provider, both of which were scuppered.

No named individual was arrested in connection to Cracked.

Meanwhile, in a separate crackdown, the US and Dutch Politie jointly announced the disruption of a Pakistan-based fraud network.

The network was comprised of websites devoted to selling products like phishing kits, which were later used to carry out Business Email Compromise (BEC) schemes – the most economically damaging cybercrime in the US, the FBI reckons.

Run by a group known as Saim Raza, aka HeartSender, a total of 39 domains and their associated servers were seized by the US and Netherlands.

https://www.pcworld.com/article/2578268/your-tax-return-is-a-ripe-target-for-fraud-heres-how-to-protect-it.html,2025-01-20T14:00:00Z,"A new year means another tax season—and all the associated headaches. Not just navigating the byzantine maze of US tax code, but dodging related scams, too.

One particular tax scam is especially thorny since it can happen right under your nose. In an attempt to collect a refund, a fraudster files a tax return in your name. But you won’t know it until you go to file yourself and discover a mess to untangle. The risk of this happening is higher in 2025 too after last year’s repeated data breaches. At this point, most everyone’s personal information (including social security numbers) is findable somewhere on the dark web.

Fortunately, the IRS makes this kind of scam easy to block. On the agency’s website, you can request an identity protection PIN, a six-digit numeric string that you must add to your filing. It identifies your tax return as the legitimate one—if a filing lacks the PIN, it won’t count.

Previously, this program was only available to victims of identity theft, either by request or decision of the IRS. Now all taxpayers can voluntarily opt into the program.

To sign up, head to the IRS website. The quickest method for verification is through the government’s ID.me service, but you can also do so through mail or an in-person appointment. The online process takes about 15-20 minutes.

Identity protection PINs are good for only one year and can’t be reused. (A smart system, so that if a number is ever stolen or compromised after use, you’re not vulnerable to fraud again.) When voluntarily enrolling, you can choose to receive a PIN on a continual basis or just one time only. Most people will be best off automatically having the IRS send a new PIN each year—less to think about during an already hectic period. You can use your ID.me login to look up your PIN.

(Speaking of logins, if you’re not already doing so, a password manager is a secure way to create and keep track of your credentials. You definitely want a unique, strong password for locking down this government account.)"
https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article298734998.html,2025-01-18T14:18:52Z,"A former pastor in the North Carolina mountains is accused of stealing “large amounts of cash donations” from church members and the community that were intended for Hurricane Helene relief, a sheriff said Friday.

Jeffrey Brian Merrow, a 60-year-old Marion resident, was taken into custody Jan. 5 on charges of embezzlement and larceny, both felonies, McDowell County Sheriff Ricky Buchanan said. Merrow was freed on $5,000 secured bond.

On Oct. 28, sheriff’s Deputy Alicia Lund spoke with members of Garden Creek Baptist Church about claims of embezzlement, fraud and theft, according to a sheriff’s office statement. Merrow was pastor of the church at the time, sheriff’s officials said.

Church members showed numerous receipts to Lund for items “that were never purchased and services that were never performed, all paid for with church money,” according to the sheriff’s office.

“One receipt was for a claim to a local insurance company for items that were never stolen,” according to the statement.

Church members also reported that cash given to Merrow for Helene relief never went to its intended use. Sheriff’s officials haven’t disclosed the amount of money they believe was stolen.

And community-donated items for Helene relief were reported stolen, including generators, chainsaws and heaters, the sheriff’s office said.

Merrow is on supervised probation for obtaining property by false pretense greater than $100,000. The incident is unrelated to the latest charges, officials said.

Merrow didn’t immediately respond to a phone message from The Charlotte Observer on Saturday."
