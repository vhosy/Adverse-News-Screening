I have observed a massive surge in the wealthy seeking golden visas or second passports, driven by political and economic instability, regional volatility and declining security and peace worldwide.

Since 2012, these programs have raised around $25 billion across Europe. This was particularly accelerated during the pandemic and the subsequent war in Ukraine, with programs like golden visas becoming a part of the contingency plan for many affluent individuals.

Investors are also drawn to the economic benefits, for golden visa programs typically involve real estate investments or other business opportunities that can yield profitable returns. Additionally, residency in a stable, well-developed country can provide access to high-quality healthcare, education and a favorable tax environment. For many, the golden visa is a pathway to a more secure and diversified lifestyle.

The Surge In Golden Visa Applications

While the golden visa program may appeal to affluent individuals from less developed nations, investors from the U.S. and the U.K. make a large percentage of beneficiaries of such programs, which offer their own versions of golden visas, have seen a surge in the number of investors seeking a golden visa with a particular interest in the EU and Caribbean. According to a survey, almost 60% of the U.S. investors cited it being a ""Plan B,"" while some seek lower cost of living and cheaper education.

Various governments initiated schemes to take advantage of golden visas and boost their countries' economies. The formula for those seeking the visa was simple: Invest in the economy, usually in real estate, for a certain number of years and get a new nationality.

Social media has been observed to have a great role in raising awareness and even influence people to opt for golden visas. In fact, my organization has been involved in social media marketing and has had success in acquiring clients through this means.

According to an article in Firstpost, a YouTube video, ""Countries for Americans Who Want to Leave the US,"" has amassed over 500,000 views and 4,000 comments in two weeks, while a Reddit thread on ""Emigrating After the US Election Results"" got over 1,000 comments in the same timeframe.

But this massive surge has also caused various problems for countries. Portugal saw a massive spike in prices and rents in the residential sector, where investors bought and rented out their residential properties; this sparked outrage among the locals and led to massive protests. The government changed the policy drastically, ""officially discontinuing the real estate option."" However, while real estate investments are often viewed as the most investor-friendly option, there are still other ways.

Understanding The Business Landscape In Your Target Location

Finding the right business idea for a particular city or neighborhood requires careful research. There are many options to consider, from everyday services like laundromats and gas stations to more specialized businesses like IT companies. Another good approach is to buy an existing business that is already successful and generating income.

Investors seeking golden visas can develop housing or apartment buildings, potentially purchasing land and using turnkey construction. While EU and U.S. residency options are narrowing (with the U.K., Ireland, Montenegro and Spain partially or fully ending their programs), opportunities remain. For those seeking residency without running a business, options like bank deposits or government bonds exist, typically requiring a $200,000 minimum investment. Stock market investments also offer a potentially lucrative alternative over a five-year period.

Tightening Regulatory Environments

The EU is continuously pressuring its members to make the golden visa regulations more stringent. For example, as of this writing, Spain is set to ban golden visas through property investment. However, Caribbean countries and countries like the U.S, UAE and Hungary still offer attractive ways to invest and build a life abroad.

For investors seeking golden visas primarily for a second passport without needing to relocate, political stability may be less significant. Countries with strong passport rankings and some political instability can still be viable, especially when financial requirements are lowered to attract participants.

Grandfather clauses, as seen in Spain and Portugal, protect existing golden visa holders under the original terms even if regulations change. This ensures that initial investments or submitted applications remain valid. In tightening regulatory environments, acting swiftly can help investors secure benefits before further restrictions are imposed."

Annual revenue run rate for Microsoft's AI business is up 175% YoY

Microsoft opened two new data center regions last quarter

Microsoft revenue climbed a very healthy 12% year-over-year in the final three months of 2024, bringing the total quarterly figure to $69.6 billion and surpassing previous analyst expectations.

In an official announcement, CEO Satya Nadella noted Microsoft's AI business’s annual revenue run rate now stands at $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.

“We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead,” said Nadella.

Microsoft revenue propped up by AI

CFO Amy Hood confirmed Microsoft Cloud revenue for the most recent quarter rose 21% year-over-year to $40.9 billion. Key to its success has been the growing demand for AI tools and data centers.

The company was keen to highlight Copilot in Excel with Python, the launch of Microsoft Places, LinkedIn upgrades, and two new data center region launches – New Zealand North and Taiwan North, as particularly key recent AI launches.

Speaking on the earnings call, Nadella added: “We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years.”

Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue grew by 8%, with its Commercial counterpart seeing a 16% growth, with businesses looking to invest in connected services powered by artificial intelligence.

The substantial double-digit growth is largely responsible for Microsoft’s recent financial success, but other areas of the business also saw minor upticks. Its Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased by 4% while Xbox content and services revenue increased by 2%, indicative of slow but steady consumer interest.

However, while the deprecation of Windows 10 is set to see consumer spending rise when it comes to hardware and software updates, some personal customers have been left with a bitter taste in their mouths after Microsoft 365 subscriptions became more expensive this month. Some Australian customers are seeing price hikes of up to 46%.

Most of the stocks rose in Q4, benefiting from the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, while other regional markets came under pressure amid worries over trade tariffs, according to GlobalData, publishers of RBI.

Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles Analyst at GlobalData, said: “The Federal Reserve implemented consecutive interest rate cuts of 25 basis points in November 2024 and December 2024. However, in December 2024, the Fed sparked a stock market sell-off by reducing the projected number of interest rate cuts for 2025. This adjustment was driven by concerns over persistently stubborn inflation.

“China unveiled a series of stimulus measures during the last quarter, extending its support beyond the traditional interest rate cuts. The country’s central bank emphasised its commitment to support economic growth by lowering the reserve requirement ratio, revising mortgage terms, and providing liquidity support for stock buybacks. However, not all these measures have been fully implemented, and their impact remains limited to date.”

US banks lead the way

JPMorgan Chase continues to remain as the world’s largest bank by market cap, recording an increase of 37.2% to $674.9bn by the end of Q4 2024. This growth was primarily fueled by higher asset management fees in its Asset & Wealth Management and Consumer & Community Banking divisions, as well as a notable rise in investment banking fees, which enabled it to outpace its competitors.

Goldman Sachs posted a stellar 42.9% growth, which propelled it to ninth place in the chart from 13th position in the previous quarter. The growth reflects its success in capital markets and advisory businesses.

However, TD Bank’s market cap declined by 20.1% to $93.1bn, following a disappointing fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates. The bank also suspended several of its mid-term financial growth targets after failing to meet them for fiscal 2024. Additionally, TD Bank agreed to pay a fine exceeding $3bn after pleading guilty to violations of US anti-money laundering regulations.

Chinese big four banks see 30%-40% rise

The market value of China’s top four banks – ICBC, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Construction Bank – experienced growth in the range of 30%-40% over the year. It was largely driven by the stimulus package announced in September 2024. This package comprised a series of monetary measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These actions were designed to inject approximately $113bn-114bn into the economy, with the goal of enhancing liquidity, revitalising the housing market, and stabilising financial markets.

European banks presented a mixed bag of results. HSBC Holdings saw a modest increase in market cap by 13.5% to reach $176.9bn, as it focused on its Asia-centric strategy. UBS Group faced stagnation with its market cap dipping slightly (-0.4%) due to the integration challenges following its acquisition of Credit Suisse.

Indian banks demonstrated resilience, with ICICI Bank emerging as a standout performer, with its market cap growing by 25.8% to $105.7bn, highlighting the strength of India’s expanding digital banking and credit ecosystem. However, HDFC Bank’s market cap growth remained subdued, recording just a 1.6% increase to $158.5bn, due to rising competition and cost pressures.

Grandhi concluded: “GlobalData predicts that tariffs expected to be imposed under Trump’s administration and planned tax cuts in 2025 may offset each other. However, risks such as rising sovereign debt, a stronger dollar, foreign outflows from emerging markets, geopolitical tensions in West Asia, China’s economic stimulus, and the yen carry trade are key factors likely to influence market performance and economic growth.”"

The company's Experiences segment - which includes the theme parks and Disney Cruise Line - saw a 3% increase in revenue, to $9.415 billion. Operating income ticked up slightly, by $0.5 million, to $3.110 billion.

The international parks carried the segment during the quarter, with higher attendance and per capita guest spending pushing their operating income up 28%. Attendance was down at Walt Disney World, however, due to the two hurricanes, including one that closed the resort for a day and saw the cancellation of a Disney Cruise Line sailing. Disney also reported higher costs in the segment due to the Disney Cruise Line's expansion, which saw the Disney Treasure launch in December.

""Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income declined 5%, reflecting a 9 percentage-point adverse impact to year-over-year growth due to the hurricanes and cruise pre-opening expenses,"" Disney said in its earnings report.

Nevertheless, Disney said that it anticipates 6% to 8% operating income growth for the Experiences segment in its 2025 fiscal year, which runs through the end of September. During that time, Disneyland will kick off its 70th anniversary celebration in May, and Hong Kong Disneyland will open its 20th anniversary party this summer. And, oh yeah, Universal is opening a new theme park in Orlando, too.

""Our Ql results for our Experiences segment demonstrated Disney's strong and enduring appeal in family travel,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said. ""We continue work on a robust slate of new projects as we bring our most popular IP to life in innovative ways and execute against a carefully designed and planned investment strategy.

https://www.webpronews.com/microsoft-reveals-massive-financial-growth-in-q2-2025-cloud-and-ai-lead-the-charge/,2025-01-30T13:32:03Z,"In what has become an expected pattern, Microsoft announced another quarter of robust financial growth, highlighting the pivotal role of its cloud services and AI innovations. The tech giant’s Q2 2025 earnings, reported on January 29, 2025, showcased a company not just keeping pace but setting the pace in the tech industry’s race towards digital transformation.

Financial Highlights

Microsoft’s Q2 2025 earnings were nothing short of stellar. The company reported revenue of $69.6 billion, marking a 12% increase year-over-year. This growth was underpinned by significant gains in its cloud business, particularly Azure, and its burgeoning AI sector. Earnings per share stood at $3.23, surpassing analyst expectations and indicating a healthy profit margin despite the massive investments in AI infrastructure.

Microsoft Cloud: With a total revenue of $40.9 billion, up 21%, Microsoft’s cloud services are the backbone of its financial success. Azure alone saw a 31% growth, with AI services contributing 13 percentage points to this figure. This is a testament to the company’s strategic focus on cloud computing and AI integration.

AI Revenue: The AI business has been highlighted as one of Microsoft’s fastest-growing areas, with an annual revenue run rate now exceeding $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year. This figure underscores Microsoft’s position as a leader in the AI revolution, integrating AI into products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure AI services.

Market Reaction

Despite the positive earnings report, Microsoft’s shares experienced a downturn in after-hours trading, dropping 4.5%. This unexpected market reaction was primarily due to concerns over the company’s AI spending and the competitive landscape, particularly with the entry of cost-effective AI models from China, like DeepSeek.

@alex on X noted, “$MSFT: ‘Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.’ ‘This quarter Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year’ – 31% growth at ‘Azure and other cloud services revenue'”.

@ZorTrades observed, “Microsoft: AI Strength, Cloud Disappointment Microsoft’s stock took a hit in after-hours trading, despite reporting strong earnings per share and revenue beats. The problem? The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, missed estimates despite growing 19% YoY.”.

Strategic Implications

Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud computing isn’t just about financial gains; it’s about positioning the company at the forefront of technological innovation:

AI Integration: The integration of AI across Microsoft’s product lineup, from Microsoft 365 to Azure, shows a strategic bet on AI being the next frontier for computing. This move is not just about enhancing current offerings but about creating new paradigms in how businesses and consumers interact with technology.

Cloud Dominance: Azure’s continued growth, even amidst global economic uncertainties, demonstrates Microsoft’s stronghold in the cloud market. The company’s investments in expanding its cloud infrastructure are paying dividends, offering scalability and flexibility that enterprises demand.

Competitive Landscape: The rise of competitors like DeepSeek, offering AI solutions at lower costs, introduces a new dynamic in the market. Microsoft’s response, including the integration of DeepSeek into its Azure offerings, suggests an adaptive strategy to maintain its market dominance while embracing broader AI accessibility.

Cloud and AI Investments Paying Off

Microsoft’s Q2 2025 earnings paint a picture of a company in robust health, powered by strategic investments in cloud and AI. However, the market’s reaction to these results indicates that investors are keenly watching how Microsoft navigates the increasingly competitive AI landscape and manages its substantial capital expenditures.

@danielnewmanUV commented on X, “Here we go Microsoft: Always my favorite visual from @EconomyApp The rapid leg down was all about cloud missing the number and sequential Azure growth being down. The recovery is all about the AI Revenue number being up 175% to $13 Billion and knowing this is VERY EARLY in.”

As we move into 2025, Microsoft’s journey will be one to watch, balancing innovation with investor expectations, in a tech world where AI and cloud computing define the future of business."

https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/arm-could-raise-chip-tech-licensing-price-by-up-to-300.html,2025-01-14T21:36:02Z,"Arm has been one of the most important companies in the development of the smartphone industry. Its technology is present in the chips of the vast majority of mobile devices and low-power electronics worldwide. However, it seems that its financial growth has not kept pace. Now, Arm reportedly wants to change that with an increase in the prices of its chip technology and the development of its own hardware.

Arm reportedly to increase prices for its chip technology by up to 300%

If you are not aware, Arm provides the Cortex CPU core designs present in virtually all smartphone and tablet chips. It also develops the Mali and Immortalis GPUs that are usually combined with its CPU cores. Major chip developers, such as Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek, turn to Arm to license their designs. Under the contract, Arm takes a small royalty for each chip unit produced with its technology.

Now, Reuters reports that Arm is considering up to a 300% increase in prices for its developments. More specifically, this could apply to ready-made parts of chip designs. In other words, technologies like stock Cortex-A7xx cores and Immortalis GPUs could soon become much more expensive.

If implemented, the change could not affect big names in the chip development industry like Qualcomm and Apple. These companies can develop their own custom CPU cores based on Arm technologies. Apple has been doing this for a long time, while Qualcomm recently re-implemented custom cores—Oryon—in phone and laptop chips. Samsung also designs its own CPU cores for Exynos chips. Not so for MediaTek, though, since even its most expensive SoCs use stock Cortex CPU cores.

Designing its own chipsets is also on the table

In addition to the potential price increase in its licenses, Arm is also reportedly planning to develop its own chipsets. That is, the company could not limit itself to designing the CPU architecture to sell to external SoC manufacturers but could become direct competition for some of its main clients in the industry.

Arm is not happy with the pace of its business growth. Ironically, brands that use its technology as the basis of their products achieve much higher revenues. In 2024, Arm achieved revenues of 3.23 billion dollars, while Apple’s for the same year were up to 90 times greater.

The report refers to the company’s new business model as the “Picasso” Project. The idea isn’t exactly new, having been in development since 2019. After all, such a major change couldn’t be designed and implemented overnight. Part of the plan was revealed during the trial against Qualcomm, where Arm—unsuccessfully—sought to negotiate a new licensing deal.

Arm reportedly wants the “Picasso” Project to bring in around $1 billion a year from the smartphone industry over the next ten years. Only time will tell if the firm is able to achieve its goal."
http://skift.com/2025/02/02/feeding-frenzy-the-year-of-ma-in-travel-tech/,2025-02-02T14:00:00Z,"TravelPerk kicked off the year with some big news: The late-stage corporate travel tech startup raised $200 million and acquired another company.

Both developments were wrapped into a single announcement that exemplifies a major trend in travel tech right now: A surge in acquisitions by private-equity backed software companies.

Private equity firms have accumulated an estimated $3 trillion that they need to deploy, and roughly $300 billion of that is earmarked for tech, according to investment banks we spoke to. These private equity firms have been leading large fundraises for late-stage startups that are working to modernize behind-the-scenes software that powers the travel industry. And those startups are deploying that newly raised capital to grow their businesses organically and via acquisitions.

Investment bank AGC Partners says these PE-backed players are going on a “feeding frenzy” to acquire smaller companies and consolidate their respective markets. AGC Partners estimates that there were roughly 180 M&A deals in travel tech last year, accounting for roughly one-third of all tech deals. That number has been steadily increasing since the low of roughly 77 deals in 2021.

“This is by far the biggest year that the space has ever seen from a transaction perspective in terms of count,” said Jonathan Weibrecht, partner at investment bank AGC Partners.

We’ve spoken to nearly a dozen founders and CEOs of companies that secured large fundraises over the last year, and nearly all of them have said M&A is on the radar. Investment bankers and private equity investors say they’re expecting an even busier year in 2025.

Driving the action: Tech systems need upgrades to handle unprecedented growth in travel, and private equity firms are deploying billions to take part. In 2025, expect more consolidation as well-funded late-stage startups buy up smaller players, reshaping the industry’s behind-the-scenes infrastructure ecosystem.

“We expect to see more activity in 2025 than 2024 in terms of number of deals,” said Min Liu, managing director of the travel practice for investment bank Cambon Partners.

Private Equity Dives into Travel

Nearly every major late-stage startup platform has just raised capital or is in the process, Weibrecht said.

Flyr, for example, raised $225 million toward its effort to replace the decades-old airline retail infrastructure with something akin to online shopping. Lighthouse raised $370 million for a platform that helps hotels make decisions about pricing, promotion, and distribution. And Hostaway raised $365 million for short-term rental management tech.

Following that trend, there likely are more large capital raises coming in 2025.

“Private equity hasn't really paid a lot of attention to travel much at all for a long time. I think it’s a sign of maturity within a market when you see private equity coming in,” said Laurence Tosi, managing partner and founder of WestCap. Tosi was Airbnb’s CFO for nearly three years starting in 2015 and helped Brian Chesky secure billions of dollars in funding.

WestCap led the last two funding rounds for Flyr, which has made multiple acquisitions in the past couple of years.

Background Players Take the Stage

Consumer brands like Expedia Group and Booking Holdings dominated M&A cycles last decade, consolidating the consumer market to create the giants that exist today.

Much of the activity in that space has settled, with exceptions, and the focus now is on consolidating the business-to-business tech.

About 80% of the 180 travel tech deals last year were involving business-to-business software, according to data from AGC Partners.

“Whenever you get funding, inevitably follows a period of consolidation, or movement amongst the different players,” Tosi said.

For example, Mews, a hotel tech startup, recently bought its fifth company in the past year – that makes 12 acquisitions since 2019.

Backed by private equity company Kinnivek and Goldman Sachs, with credit from Vista Equity Partners, Mews is focused on M&A as a strategy for growth, said founder Richard Valtr.

Mews is in the business of trying to modernize an antiquated piece of hotel tech, the property management system. Whether it’s Mews or Flyr or Travelperk, building these platforms and growing the client base is capital intensive — even more so now as the rise of AI forces founders to reimagine their products.

Despite so much money being available for large fundraises, early stage funding is still tight for young startups because investors are looking for companies with proven business models.

That means startups and small businesses will have a hard time investing at the level needed to upgrade tech and scale.

“That requires a lot of investment. And In order to make that investment, you need to have scale. And if you don't have scale, you can't make that investment, and you fall further behind,” said Akhil Chainwala, senior investment director for private equity firm Kinnevik. The firm led the last round for Mews and participated in the past few rounds for TravelPerk.

Valtr of Mews says that’s why it often makes sense for those smaller companies to join well-funded companies rather than continue independently.

“I think for a lot of providers, it's basically a double whammy. First, they thought they could still kind of ride out the cloud wave. And now, thinking about how they're going to ride out the AI wave is making a lot of them feel nervous. So I feel like that's one of the things that is driving interest (in selling),” Valtr said.

“If you haven't really invested into that core R&D piece of your system for a long time, it's difficult to actually start that up.”

Nearly 40% of the travel tech M&A deals last were involving hotel tech, AGC Partners found. But the firm expects more activity in the airline tech space as new platforms push to scale.

“It's a very attractive software market because retention is so incredibly high,” Weibrecht said.

Motivation to Grow

The investment bankers say that these PE-backed companies are going on acquisition sprees because they need to grow revenue.

AGC expects this type of strategy to continue over the next two years.

“The use of funds for all of these capital raises is to go do follow-on M&A,” Weibrecht said.

“You've got all these companies between $50 million and several hundred million of net [annual recurring revenue], too small to be public … probably too small for the premium-paying horizontal acquirers to snap them up. And so what they need to do is they need to go and buy revenue.”

Mews is one that will eventually get to the exit point, and that’s something its leaders have to think about. It’s still a relatively small company now in terms of market share, with several notable competitors (including market share leader Oracle Hospitality.)

“I think at our scale and our size, it's difficult to understand who would be the potential acquirers,” Valtr said. “I think that I wouldn't be performing my fiduciary duty if I didn't say that we'd always look at what would be the best outcome for our shareholders and, ultimately, for our customers. So I think if we could also go towards an IPO, I think that would also be a great mark.”

Who’s Selling

The selling price for most of the deals in 2024 was undisclosed. That often — but not always — means the deals were small.

It’s more of a consolidation of fragments, with buyers looking to add clients or geographic coverage, improve tech, or add a group of new employees. The sellers are often companies generating between $5 million and $50 million in annual recurring revenue, AGC said.

“A lot of what we like to do with our companies is what we call strategic bolt-on acquisitions. So they're not necessarily transformational, but they're adding a product set they didn't already have,” Tosi said.

The sellers are often smaller startups that made deals before the pandemic and are now having a harder time securing venture capital. If they’re struggling to get to the next stage, now is a good time to exit.

Baby Boomer founders are another group of sellers, looking for an exit as they prepare to retire. They often have small, independent businesses — like corporate travel agencies or old hotel tech — with loyal customers.

Juniper Group is open to hearing from them. The company plans to buy as many as a dozen travel tech companies this year, according to Jaime Sastre, CEO of Juniper Group.

“Next year, we'll do more, and the next one, we'll do more,” Sastre said.

While the company isn’t backed by private equity, it has jumped full force into the travel M&A market. Sastre formed Juniper Group in 2020, and it now has 31 companies, including around a dozen in travel.

Juniper Group is an operating portfolio of Vela Software, one of the six divisions of Toronto-based Constellation Software, which owns more than 1,000 companies. It has an unusual model: It buys small travel tech companies, grows their revenue, and then uses that revenue to grow organically and buy more. Unlike private equity, which typically sells portfolio companies after about five years, Juniper Group plans to “never” sell any of its companies.

Juniper Group would be buying regardless, Sastre said, but he thinks the market has eased a bit since the pandemic. The companies that survived are growing again.

“It's a good moment probably to sell because they suffered Covid, they're revamping now with that growth and better profitability, and it's probably a good moment for them to to get out and for others to get in,” Sastre said.

He said Juniper Group often appeals to owner-operators ready to step away from such heavy responsibility while also continuing to run the company. Because Juniper never sells, the stakes are a bit different.

“We don't care about how much our companies are worth. All we care about is how much return are we getting from those companies, and what's the future in terms of financial growth of this company.”

Moving Money

While middle market companies are leading the charge, there’s plenty of activity elsewhere.

Travel corporations, finally seeing substantial recovery post-pandemic, are deploying their own capital into growth initiatives. Amadeus, for example, made two big purchases.

Despegar plans to sell to tech investment firm Prosus for $1.7 billion.

And there will always be companies changing hands in big private equity acquisition deals. Cvent, for example, was fully acquired in 2023 for $4.6 billion. “At some point in time, you need to change the profile of your investors who can continue your company’s journey for the next stage of growth,” Liu said.

And for a similar reason as the buildup of private equity, Liu suspects there could be IPOs in the near future from travel companies who have been talking about it but haven't pulled the trigger.

The parent company of Hotelbeds, for example, just said it’s planning an IPO at a valuation of $5.1 billion.

“Very strong landmark deal this year — the first one to watch,” Liu said.

“This is a case where investors held because of Covid. You will see that the financial performance has been very, very good post-Covid. Now is a good time to go to market again, and the IPO market is opening.”

Regulatory Hurdles

For any large deals, there’s the issue of regulations to watch out for. And that may be a deterrent, Liu said.

Industry leaders suspect there may be relaxed regulation around M&A in the U.S. under the new presidential administration. But large deals often are subject to EU approval, as well, and that can cause deals to fall apart.

Booking Holdings was blocked from buying eTraveli Group for that reason. And it’s unclear whether Amex GBT will be allowed to purchase CWT. It’s not in the travel space, but the Trump administration has already sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise from acquiring Juniper Networks (unrelated to Juniper Group).

That means traditional acquirers, like Google and Booking Holdings, need to take precautions before attempting deals.

“Booking — really, any type of deal is difficult because of this regulatory scrutiny,” Liu said.

“​​I don't see very, very large deals happening in this space in the coming years. For large deals, for mergers of equals, there will be increased scrutiny from regulators.”

But smaller companies, the ones dominating the cycle now, likely won’t need to worry about that.

“It's very active in the small, mid-sized deals because there's a lot of market interest and investor interest to build platforms. So they are the main driving force of the activity on the market currently,” Liu said.

Navigating the Risk

While there is a lot of consolidation happening, acquisitions come with a level of risk and consequence that some don’t believe is worth it.

Adam Harris, CEO of hotel tech company and Mews competitor Cloudbeds, told Skift last year that M&A hasn’t been a growth strategy for his company — though that could change in the future.

He believes the process can create a bad experience for clients. And, the cost of integrating them takes away from resources that the company would use to improve the product.

""We’ve seen other companies roll up players similar to them, but we haven’t necessarily seen that followed by a tremendous amount of organic customer growth. This makes us wonder how well that horizontal strategy is working for hoteliers,"" Harris said.

Although Flyr has made multiple acquisitions over the past two years, Flyr CEO Alex Mans said it’s not an easy process to undergo because it often means integrating different company culture, products, and geographies.

“It's always much harder than you think it’s going to be,” Mans told Skift last year. “I'm still very fortunate that we were able to aquire great companies with great people that are really helping us grow and accelerate the business. But that, too, is also harder and more difficult than you think it is when you do it.”

Building a company via acquisition also doesn’t guarantee it’ll turn out successfully. Look at travel agency tech company Mondee, which just filed bankruptcy after acquiring five companies in 2023.

Still, Valtr of Mews believes it’s a good way to more quickly move the industry forward.

“I think that people tend to see M&A as this terrible thing. It doesn't need to be this negative perspective: These are private equity companies that are going to come in and just try and milk the customers as much as possible,” Valtr said. “You can still be a fast-scaling, product-first company, and still also be wanting to liberate the rest of the market from these legacy solutions.”

https://cryptoslate.com/oh-raises-4-5-million-to-empower-creators-through-ai-and-web3-fusion/,2025-01-11T03:00:58Z,"Oh, an innovative platform blending AI with Web3 technology has secured $4.5 million in seed funding, according to a Jan. 10 statement shared with CryptoSlate.

The oversubscribed round saw contributions from major players like Tangent, Big Brain Holdings, Kosmos Ventures, Tagus Capital, and Bodhi Ventures. It also received support from prominent angel investors like Delphi Ventures’ Yan Liberman.

What is Oh?

Oh aims to revolutionize how creators produce, interact, and profit in the Web3 era by integrating decentralization, user empowerment, and advanced AI technology.

Nic Young, co-founder and CEO of Oh, stated that the platform seeks to transform the creator economy by merging AI’s personalization strengths with the decentralized and censorship-resistant features of Web3. He emphasized that this combination offers a disruptive model for creators and their audiences.

He said:

“The intersection of AI and Web3 represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to disrupt the creator economy. By combining AI’s ability to generate and personalize content with the power to create communities with agentic capabilities, built on the decentralization and censorship resistance of Web3, traditional systems simply can’t compete.”

Ohchats and superModels

At the core of Oh’s ecosystem is OhChat, an AI-powered platform boasting a user base of nearly 100,000 across 174 countries. The platform allows users to interact with AI-generated characters, from unique digital personalities to virtual replicas of real-world figures.

Notably, celebrities like Carmen Electra and Kaili Thorne are already using the platform to engage millions of followers through AI-enhanced digital twins. Building on this success, Oh plans to launch “superModels” — autonomous, next-generation AI digital creators.

These AI agents go beyond simple interactions, offering dynamic capabilities such as building a social media presence, remembering user interactions, and developing evolving personalities.

SuperModel owners can monetize these digital agents, launch tokens linked to their revenue, and benefit from permissionless buybacks. This approach allows creators and their communities to share in the financial growth presented by the projects.

Token launch

Oh’s roadmap includes introducing token capabilities in the first quarter of this year to support its ecosystem."
https://www.fool.com.au/2025/01/11/the-iag-share-price-soared-50-in-2024-heres-how/,2025-01-10T20:00:00Z,"The Insurance Australia Group Ltd (ASX: IAG) share price just capped off a year to remember.

Shares in the S&PASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) insurance company closed out 2023 trading for $5.66. When the closing bell sounded on 31 December 2024, those same shares were changing hands for $8.46.

That put the IAG stock up a remarkable 49.5% over the year. For some context, the ASX 200 gained 7.5% in 2024.

And this is a company with a market cap north of $20 billion we're talking about, not some speculative ASX microcap stock. And we haven't even included the 27 cents a share in partly franked dividends IAG paid out over the year.

If we add those back in, the cumulative value of shares in the ASX 200 insurance stock leapt 54.2% in 2024.

Here's what went right for the IAG share price in the year just past.

How did the IAG share price rocket 50% in 2024?

As you can see on the chart up top, the IAG share price was in a pronounced uptrend throughout 2024 amid strong financial growth metrics posted over the year.

IAG reported its full FY 2024 results on 21 August.

Highlights included a 7.9% year-on-year increase in net profit after tax (NPAT) to $898 million. While IAG's reported insurance margin lifted by 6.0% from FY 2023 to 15.6%.

The insurance company's gross written premium (GWP) also grew strongly, coming in at $16.4 billion for the year, up 11%.

Likely stoking ASX 200 investor interest, IAG said it was aiming for FY 2025 GWP growth in the ""mid-to-high single digits"".

ASX 200 insurer roars to multi-year highs

The IAG share price received another big boost on 28 November,

That's when the company announced that it had entered into a 25-year exclusive strategic alliance to provide general insurance products and services for RACQ members and Queenslanders.

Under the agreement, IAG will acquire 90% of RACQ's existing insurance underwriting business for a consideration of $855 million. IAG has the option to acquire the remaining 10% in two years.

""IAG has a well-established presence in Queensland through our trusted insurance brands, and we are excited to now help protect and serve RACQ's members,"" IAG CEO Nick Hawkins said on the day.

Hawkins added:

RACQ will maintain brand and customer relationships, while leveraging IAG's scale and financial strength, best-in-class technology for claims, policies and pricing, customer orientated claims experience and underwriting expertise.

At the close of trade on Friday, the IAG share price was up 0.65% so far in 2025, with shares trading for $8.515 each."
