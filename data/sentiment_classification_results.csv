Unfortunately, no one warned the two imposters of this when they decided to pose as members of the FCC “Fraud Prevention Team” and they ended up calling FCC staff members. Now the company that enabled the whole fraudulent operation is staring down a $4.5 million fine.

Here’s how this whole thing went down, according to the FCC: Two people who identified themselves by the names “Christian Mitchell” and “Henry Walker” registered accounts with Telnyx, a VOIP service provider based in Texas. The two claimed to be living at the same address in Toronto, Canada, despite the fact that their IP addresses pinned them in Scotland and England, and they both had email addresses registered to the domain mariocop123.com.

Despite the indicators that something fishy was afoot, Telnyx allowed the two to register accounts anyway, which they used to launch a very short-lived spam call campaign. Over the course of two days in February 2024, the two scammers placed 1,797 imposter calls claiming to be coming from the Federal Communications Commission’s Fraud Prevention Team—a thing that does not exist.

Most of the callers ended up with a prerecorded voicemail left in their inbox. For the few unfortunate souls who picked up, the FCC said they were subjected to attempts to “threaten, intimidate, and defraud.” One victim reported that the fraudsters demanded they pay $1,000 in Google gift cards to avoid jail time for “crimes against the state.”

Somehow, at least a few of those 1,797 calls that the scammers placed managed to hit the phones of FCC staff members and their families. The FCC still isn’t sure how that happened, as the agency stated it doesn’t “publish or otherwise share staff personal phone numbers.”

However that happened, it seems to have put the whole operation on the FCC’s radar, and now it’s coming down on Telnyx for failing to comply with Know Your Customer rules designed to prevent malicious actors from making use of these networks in the first place. Per the FCC’s investigation, the VOIP firm only collected a name, email address, physical address, and IP address from the applicants, with no verification process in place to confirm that information.

22 January 2025

Jack Fenwick & Paul Seddon

Political reporter

Convicted benefits cheats who fail to pay back the taxpayer could be stripped of their driving licences, under government plans to crack down on fraud.

Those who repeatedly cheat the system and have debts of £1,000 or more could be punished with a driving ban of up to two years.

Fraudsters can already be jailed in the most serious cases - but Work and Pensions Minister Alison McGovern said it would provide an additional ""tool in the box"" to chase repayments.

The plans also include new powers to force banks to hand over account information about benefit claimants to help target investigations, echoing a scheme announced by the previous Conservative government.

But this is likely to face strong opposition from the banks and privacy campaigners.

Providing false information to obtain benefits can see fraudsters hit by fines, while serious cases of conspiracy to defraud can attract prison sentences of up to ten years, under current laws.

Pressed on whether the power to disqualify drivers would provide an additional deterrent, McGovern told BBC Breakfast it would provide a ""backstop"" to chase repayment from those determined to ""evade collection"".

She added that the department already tries to collect fraudulently claimed benefits via banks or the PAYE system, but the licence powers could help with those who still ""don't want to co-operate"".

According to latest annual figures, overpayments due to fraud amounted to £7.4bn last year, around 2.8% of total welfare spending.

A further £1.6bn (0.6%) was overpaid due to inadvertent errors by claimants, with £0.8bn (0.3%) overpaid because of errors by the DWP.

Ministers have estimated greater access to banking data could save taxpayers £1.5bn over five years, by helping DWP investigators identify suspect claims more effectively.

But campaign groups have warned that it will invade claimants' right to financial privacy, and could lead to legitimate claimants being wrongly investigated.

In a letter to Kendall in September, the directors of Big Brother Watch and Age UK described the plans as ""mass financial surveillance powers"" which they said would ""represent a severe and disproportionate intrusion into the nation's privacy"".

Tory bill failed

Currently, the department can only request such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.

The previous government argued broader powers to obtain banking information in bulk would help investigators catch previously undiscovered fraud cases.

But a Tory bill to deliver the scheme failed to make it through Parliament before July's election.

Under that plan, financial institutions would have been required to send information to the DWP about bank accounts receiving benefit payments that indicated a ""potential risk"" of fraud or error, or face fines for not complying.

An official assessment of the law said the system would be ""fully automated, running within existing banking systems"" and be rolled out gradually from 2027.

At the time, Labour attacked the Tory legislation as ""poorly delineated"" – while Tory ministers argued wide-ranging powers were necessary to ensure they could apply to all types of future banks, including accounts with newer, online-only providers.

Conservative shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said the government's bill was a ""continuation"" of work started by the previous government and Labour ""must do more to tackle the spiralling welfare budget"".

'Living abroad'

Since entering government, Labour has pledged that only ""very limited information"" will be shared with the department under its equivalent plan, but is yet to set out in detail how its system will work.

DWP minister Andrew Western confirmed last year this will include cases where claimants are ""living abroad"" without notifying the department, although a timeframe for this has yet to be specified.

Accounts could also be flagged if they are holding more than £16,000, the usual savings limit for being able to claim Universal Credit.

In a change from Tory plans, the government has said the new powers will not be used to target payments of the state pension.

Ministers have sought to reassure critics by emphasising that the DWP will not have powers to ""access"" bank accounts.

But campaigners have told the BBC they believe this is a ""misdirection"", as the measures would give DWP the power to instruct banks to access the information on its behalf.",negative,negative,0.6531349420547485,negative,0.9983972907066344,neutral,0.9699114263057708,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.8728063404560089, 0.391899511218071, 0.029663623310625553]",negative,0.8728063404560089
https://gizmodo.com/theres-something-fishy-about-this-fish-tech-startup-2000553691,2025-01-22T21:34:29Z,"An Indonesian agriculture tech startup that raised hundreds of millions of dollars appears to be a giant fraud. The company, called eFishery, reportedly told investors including SoftBank that it had revenue of $752 million for the nine months through September of last year when the real amount was actually $157 million. That means its revenue was 75% lower than it had presented. You could call it a pescatarian ponzi.

eFishery says its mission is to address a surging global demand for animal protein by modernizing the fishing industry in Indonesia. eFishery develops end-to-end technology for fish farmers, from internet-connected smart feeders to a mobile app where farmers can sell their harvest. Shrimp in particular is quite high in protein, and the thinking was fish farmers in Indonesia could use modern tech to increase yields and supply a growing global population.

Alas, it seems not that many fisheries wanted what eFishery was selling: “While eFishery said it had over 400,000 fish feeders in operation at customers,” Bloomberg wrote, “initial investigations estimate it only had about 24,000.” eFishery has been in business since 2013.

Bloomberg earlier reported on the alleged fish fraud, which came to light after a whistleblower approached eFishery’s board with allegations that its numbers were not accurate. Besides the massive revenue discrepancy, company leadership told investors it had made $16 million in profit for a nine-month period when in fact it had lost $35.4 million.

eFishery’s CEO was fired after an investigation by the board quickly turned up accounting inconsistencies. The investigation remains ongoing, according to Bloomberg, but it seems like someone is about to receive the Elizabeth Holmes treatment.

What are the odds the founders of eFishery got their inspiration from 4chan?

https://www.businessinsider.com/frank-founder-charlie-javice-fraud-trial-jpmorgan-2025-2,2025-02-04T19:52:39Z,"The feds say Javice tricked JPMorgan Chase into paying $175M for her financial aid startup, Frank.

On Tuesday, a Manhattan judge set parameters for a February 18 criminal trial.

No one can mention Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, he ruled — unless Javice opens the door.

Charlie Javice — the young tech entrepreneur accused of tricking the nation's largest bank into paying $175 million for her college financial-aid startup — once had a lot to say about Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes.

Javice called Holmes' defrauded investors ""sophisticated assholes,"" and complained that ""investors should be blamed,"" according to a pair of WhatsApp messages that were discussed at a pretrial hearing in Manhattan on Tuesday.

When Javice and her ex-number two at their startup, Frank, go on trial for allegedly defrauding JPMorgan Chase later this month, federal prosecutors will be barred from making any mention of Theranos or Holmes, a judge ruled during the hearing.

And those WhatsApp messages between Javice and codefendant Olivier Amar, in particular, are definitely not coming into evidence, he said, unless either defendant opens the door by mentioning them on the witness stand.

""The potential for prejudice outweighs anything probative,"" US District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said in precluding the use of the two messages that prosecutors had optimistically labeled ""Government Exhibit 802.""

The two WhatsApp messages are from 2022, ""in the midst of their own efforts to defraud JPMC,"" the government alleged in court papers last week, in asking the judge to allow the ""highly probative"" texts into evidence at a trial scheduled to begin February 18.

Federal prosecutors allege that over months of negotiations, Javice and Amar repeatedly lied to Chase about the success of Frank, a for-profit tech company that Javice launched at age 24 and which featured software to help students apply for college financial aid.

Javice fraudulently claimed that Fank had 4.5 million customers, prosecutors allege, and created fake spreadsheets to trick the bank into believing they existed. She personally stood to gain $45 million in stock and salary from the deal, according to prosecutors.

""The government seeks only to offer the defendants' own statements about the defendants' own contemporaneous views about Holmes' criminal conduct, while in the midst of concealing the defendants' own criminal conspiracy,"" federal prosecutors wrote in asking last week for the judge's permission to use the WhatsApp messages as trial evidence.

In the messages, Javice and Amar are ""calling the conviction 'dangerous,' and repeating many of the defenses they intend in their own case,"" prosecutors wrote.

That includes what prosecutors call a blame-the-victim defense.

""Investors should be blamed on letting a 19-year-old go rogue,"" Javice commiserated with Amar in the messages, referring to Holmes, who founded Theranos at age 19.

Perhaps most damagingly, the texts appear to show Javice drawing a distinction between a health-based fraud, like the one Holmes was convicted of, and a fraud based on financial aid.

""I think health is different,"" Javice tells her number two in the first of the two contested, and now stricken, WhatsApp messages.

""They talk about how she was unfairly treated,"" Assistant US Attorney Georgia V. Kostopoulos told the judge Tuesday, in her failed argument for admitting the messages.

""They say health is different"" the prosecutor told the judge. ""They're saying that it's different to lie about patients' health data than it is to lie about student data.""

In their own court filings, defense lawyers for Javice and Amar had asked the judge to bar any mention at trial of ""well-known, unrelated third parties convicted of fraud, specifically Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie Madoff, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Martim Skreli, which the government has signaled it intends to introduce in its case-in-chief.""

Federal prosecutors say they have no intention of mentioning any of these infamous fradusters at trial.

Javice, who was once on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, recently lost a bid to be tried separately from Amar. It was revealed at a court hearing last month that Amar plans to go on the offensive against Javice during the trial.

A 2023 podcast and a new docuseries cover her story, which also mentions her husband, Cory.

Cory and Amanda have two sons together. Here's where Cory is today.

The story of Amanda C. Riley, a Christian woman in California who used her now-archived blog, ""Lymphoma Can Suck It,"" to chronicle her experience after supposedly being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma was compelling from the start: A young woman blogging about having cancer in order to raise awareness and funds to help pay for her aggressive treatment was actually lying the whole time, leaching attention and more than $100,000 from her friends, family, and even strangers.

It's the reason the ""Scamanda"" podcast quickly became a megahit upon its 2023 release, and why a new ABC docuseries is telling the story for a second time, delving deeper into how Riley pulled off her scheme and how she was eventually caught.

Amanda pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in October 2021, and was sentenced to five years in federal prison in May 2022. She was also ordered to pay $105,513 in restitution to her victims. She's currently incarcerated at FMC Carswell, a federal prison in Ft. Worth, Texas, and is scheduled for release on October 15, 2026.

As of January 2025, no one else has been charged with crimes related to their involvement in Amanda's scheme. However, according to the ""Scamanda"" podcast and docuseries, family members helped her set up websites to acquire donations and contributed posts to her blog. Whether any of them knew Amanda did not actually have cancer or if they truly believed she was ill is unclear.

While Amanda's fake cancer scheme was in full force, her husband Cory Riley was simultaneously battling his ex-wife Aletta Riley in court for custody of their daughter, Jessa. Per the podcast, he cited his wife's supposed diagnosis and medical expenses to try and win custody of Jessa and get his child support payments lowered.

Here's everything we know about Cory Riley's life today.

Where is Amanda C. Riley's husband Cory Riley today?

Cory and Amanda first met when Amanda was a 17-year-old cheerleading coach hired to instruct one of Cory's then-wife Aletta's daughters — one of whom actually had cancer — how to dance. Per the podcast, Cory was about 29 years old at the time.

Related stories

Cory and Aletta eventually divorced, and he married Amanda a few years later. The couple had two sons together, Carter and Connor, whom Amanda would proclaim were ""miracles,"" since she claimed she shouldn't have been able to deliver a healthy baby while undergoing cancer treatment.

Though the family lived in the Bay Area outside of San Jose for most of the time Amanda was writing her cancer blog, they moved to Texas after Amanda lost her job as principal at Pacific Point Christian School in Gilroy, California.

A Maricopa County Superior Court judge last week sentenced Bridget Corinne O'Brien to two years in prison followed by three years of probation for taking advantage of programs that were put in place to help businesses stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

O'Brien was also ordered to pay $1.3 million in restitution to the federal Small Business Administration, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes' office says.

Mayes' Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, led by special agent Roy Garrison, found that O'Brien misused the federal loan funds by purchasing a $1.9 million home in Phoenix. O'Brien also used the money to travel, to purchase clothing and furniture, and to pay for volleyball lessons for one of her children, investigators found.

O'Brien, a mother of two who has a master's degree in speech pathology, founded a Phoenix therapy clinic for children called Head to Toe Therapy, which was suspended as a provider for Arizona's Medicaid program in November 2019, state Medicaid and court records show.

A presentence report says that O'Brien's actions were ""thoughtful, intentional and perhaps prohibited money from being given to another business owner in need during a difficult time.""

O'Brien was awarded $2.9 million in U.S. Small Business Administration loans in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, court records say. Her loan applications contained ""gross material misrepresentations"" that allowed her to fraudulently obtain loans, which she subsequently misused to finance a luxurious lifestyle, state investigators found.

The presentence report says that in addition to Head to Toe Therapy, O'Brien owned ""multiple limited liability companies, many of which received COVID-19 relief loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration."" The federal agency offered two programs at the time: Paycheck Protection Program, PPP, and Economic Injury Disaster Loan, EIDL.

The sentence was handed down nearly a year after the gambling controversy first surfaced.

Mizuhara, 40, admitted to fraudulently transferring the money from Ohtani's account for more than two years to pay his gambling debts, including impersonating the athlete on two dozen occasions in calls to the bank, according to a plea agreement in the case.

The 57-month sentence was awarded for one count of bank fraud. On a second count, for subscribing to a false tax return, he was given 36 months -- to be served concurrently.

Prosecutors called the scheme ""deep"" and ""extensive"" fraud and that Ohtani was ""harmed substantially"" by Mizuhara's actions.

Mizuhara is free on $25,000 bond and is scheduled to surrender on March 24.

He was additionally sentenced to three years supervised release and ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution -- including nearly $17 million to Ohtani, more than $1 million to the IRS and court fines.

Mizuhara, a permanent resident of the U.S., also faces a risk of deportation back to his native Japan upon completion of the federal sentence, prosecutors said.

Joseph McNally, the acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said outside the courthouse in Santa Ana, California, following the hearing that the sentence reflects the ""seriousness of the offense and sends a strong message.""

He also emphasized the harm done to Ohtani, who submitted a victim impact statement to the court that has been sealed.

""In this case, he had money stolen from him. He was taken advantage of. He was preyed on by Mr. Mizuhara,"" McNally said. ""Mr. Mizuhara lied, he cheated and he stole. His behavior was shameless.""

Mizuhara made a brief statement in court ahead of his sentencing in which he apologized to Ohtani, the Dodgers, the judge and the government.

""I am not trying to justify my actions,"" he said. ""I am prepared to receive my punishment.""

His attorney, Michael Freedman, argued that Mizuhara was ""under a lot of financial stress"" when he stole from Ohtani. Judge John Holcomb, however, challenged the defense's portrayal of an underpaid worker, noting that Ohtani had given his former translator five-figure tips and a Porsche, and he had paid for all travel expenses for Mizuhara and his wife -- as well as most of their rent.

The judge also raised the fact that Mizuhara had more than $34,000 in his personal account when he took the first $40,000 from Ohtani to pay his first debt.

Mizuhara asks judge for mercy

In a three-page letter to Judge Holcomb filed ahead of the sentencing hearing, Mizuhara asked for a ""merciful and not punitive"" sentence and set out to explain why he committed the fraud.

He described mounting financial stresses that he said led him to use an online sports betting website run by Mathew Bowyer starting in 2021. He said that due to his ""ignorance to the gambling industry,"" he did not realize it was an illegal gambling business until early 2024.

""Being desperate for money at the time, I stupidly thought this might be an opportunity to help myself out financially and started to use his website for sports betting. And before I knew it, the results were the complete opposite,"" Mizuhara wrote. ""My gambling debt had grown so much that I could not find any way to pay it but to use Shohei's money. ... I felt terribly guilty about putting my hands on his money but this was the only solution I could think of at the time.""

Mizuhara also said that the offseason was ""physically and mentally"" harder while detailing some of his errands for Ohtani, such as driving him to trainings, taking his dog to the vet and fixing his bicycle -- saying he had ""almost no true days off.""

""I felt like I was getting severely underpaid but I was afraid to speak up for myself as I was on a one year contract every year and I didn't want to upset them and end up getting fired,"" he wrote.

Mizuhara said he hopes to use his experience to help others dealing with gambling problems. He also outlined the impact a prison sentence would have on his wife.

""I understand that I have made a decision that will impact my entire life and I am not making excuses for what I have done. I am not trying to justify my actions in any way. I am asking that you will look at me as a man and believe change can happen,"" he said. ""I don't believe an apology will fix my wrong. I am prepared [to] accept my consequences. I am asking for a little mercy from the court concerning my sentence you will hand down.""

He lastly said he is ""truly sorry"" for violating Ohtani's trust in him.

Defense, government make case for sentence

Mizuhara pleaded guilty last year to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum of 30 years in prison, and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, which carries up to three years in prison. A sentence of 48 months was recommended by the probation officer.

Mizuhara's attorney had asked the judge to impose an 18-month sentence, arguing in a memorandum that the interpreter was devoted to his work for Ohtani but suffers from a ""longstanding gambling addiction, which was uniquely exacerbated by his grueling work and exposure to high-stakes bookmakers in the world of professional athletes.""

Mizuhara ""made a terrible mistake as a result of his serious gambling addiction, an anomaly in an otherwise law-abiding life in which he was dedicated to his career as an interpreter for Mr. Ohtani and other baseball players,"" Freedman wrote.

The defense attorney also said Mizuhara's reputation here and in Japan has been ""irretrievably stained"" and that he ""will continue to suffer as a result of harm to his reputation and career in the global press and through certain deportation.""

Prosecutors, meanwhile, had asked the court to impose a prison sentence of 57 months while disputing what they called ""unsupported claims"" by the defense on the extent of Mizuhara's gambling problem and the financial problems he had said led him to Bowyer's illegal sports betting business.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Mitchell wrote in a response to the defense's sentencing filings that the government could find no proof of a long-standing gambling addiction, and that Mizuhara did not have ""such a 'tremendous debt' that it forced him to steal millions of dollars from Mr. Ohtani, as he claims.""

Mitchell also questioned whether Mizuhara is ""truly remorseful or whether they are just sorry they were caught"" and highlighted portions of Mizuhara's letter to the judge, in which he detailed his offseason duties for Ohtani.

""The government does not question defendant's work ethic, but only his characterization of the work and his true intention,"" Mitchell wrote. ""Instead of using this opportunity to apologize and show true remorse, he has used it, in a public filing, to complain about his work and Mr. Ohtani.""

In addition to the prison sentence, the government asked for three years of supervised release, restitution of $16,975,010 to Ohtani and $1,149,400 to the IRS.

Sentencing comes nearly year after firing

Mizuhara worked with the Angels as Ohtani's interpreter and then in the same capacity with the Dodgers, until the team fired him nearly a year ago, in March 2024, after the gambling controversy surfaced.

Ohtani addressed the scandal at the time during a press briefing, saying in a prepared statement through an interpreter, ""I am very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this.""

Mizuhara pleaded guilty to the federal charges in June 2024.

According to the plea agreement, from November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara transferred nearly $17 million from the account to associates of the bookmaker in more than 40 wires without Ohtani's permission.

Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers prior to last year, the richest deal in sports history.

Bowyer pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for running an illegal gambling business that took unlawful sports bets from hundreds of customers, including Mizuhara, the Department of Justice said. He is scheduled to be sentenced in April.

Mizuhara also admitted in the plea agreement to falsely claiming that his total taxable income for 2022 was $136,865 when, in fact, he failed to report an additional $4.1 million in income.

""The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank,"" the DOJ said, noting that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.

His sentencing was originally postponed several times after the defense asked for more time to prepare and for a forensic psychologist to complete a report about Mizuhara's gambling.

According to Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company recently filed a racketeering lawsuit that alleges a vast criminal conspiracy in which law firms, doctors, and pain management clinics teamed up to stage fake car accidents and resulting injuries in order to cash in on insurance payouts from Uber.

So here is Uber’s telling of the situation, as told by a filing submitted to the US District Court in the Eastern District of New York: Since 2019, a ring of legal and medical professionals in New York have been targeting people involved in car accidents. They grab people who have been in “purported or actual minor vehicle collisions,” making excessive claims as to the injuries they suffered in the wreck, and putting them through “medically unnecessary” and “invasive and painful” surgeries that Uber ultimately has to pay for. According to Uber, many of the medical conditions are “fictitious, exaggerated or that preexisted,” and some of the procedures to address those injuries are extreme, including “spinal fusions.”

New York State requires Uber and other ridesharing apps to maintain liability insurance on their drivers, which covers any injury that may occur to a driver or passenger as part of a ride hailed through the service. In New York City, regulations require drivers to maintain personal injury coverage, as well, for a minimum of $200,000. New York is a no-fault state, which means that insurance has to pay for coverage no matter who was “at fault” for an accident occurring—something that Uber claims these law firms and doctors were taking advantage of.

Uber is not the first company to raise the prospect of fraudulent insurance claims in New York. The American Transit Insurance Co. (ATIC), New York’s largest taxi insurer, filed a similar case last year that claimed medical providers had defrauded the company of $450 million. The lawsuit contains many of the same claims Uber made, that doctors are intentionally over-diagnosing, over-treating, and over-billing for injuries sustained from car accidents in order to cash in on the insurance policies.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, recently proposed several changes to how the insurance industry operates within the state, in no small part at the behest of ATIC as it faces major solvency issues. The proposals would include additional resources for looking into insurance fraud like the kind that both ATIC and Uber are alleging targets them.",negative,negative,0.817587673664093,negative,0.9711717963218688,negative,0.8184133768081665,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.9364978671073914, 0.3512188196182251, 0.0057283369824290276]",negative,0.9364978671073914

The truck company will also be banned from exporting its diesel engines to the country for five years.

It comes after Hino was charged with fraud in a Detroit court for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US between 2010 and 2022.

The settlement still requires approval by a US court.

According to the US Justice Department, Hino submitted ""false and fraudulent"" emission testing and fuel consumption data in a ""criminal conspiracy"" that allowed it to import and sell its engines in the United States.

""Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom-line,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.

""To further this fraudulent scheme, Hino violated laws and regulations intended to protect American's health and the environment.""

On top of the five-year diesel engine import ban, Hino has also committed to a compliance and ethics plan during that period.

""We take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program, and further strengthening of our compliance system ... are implemented,"" said Satoshi Ogiso, Hino's chief executive and president in a statement.

""We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders.""

The US Environmental Protection Agency said Hino has also agreed to recall some infringing heavy-duty trucks and to replace marine and locomotive engines across the country to offset excess air emissions.

In order to cover costs resulting from its legal problems, Hino said that in its second quarter financial results announced in October, it reported an extraordinary loss of 230 billion yen (£1.2bn, $1.48bn).

In the last decade, several car makers admitted to lying about the emissions produced by their diesel engines.

In what has become known as the dieselgate scandal, brands throughout the Volkswagen corporate empire were implicated, including Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda as well as Volkswagen itself.

Volkswagen has spent more than 30 billion euros (£25bn, $30.9bn) paying fines, issuing recalls and compensating its customers.",negative,negative,0.7489811182022095,negative,0.8000406622886658,positive,0.9957520961761476,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.9882989525794983, 0.3184919059276581, 0.019023695960640907]",negative,0.9882989525794983
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l8gqexpdo,2025-01-15T14:07:17Z,"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the government's handling of the economy, saying the UK was now ""spending more on debt than on schools and hospitals"".

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch told MPs: ""His budget means fewer jobs, lower growth and higher borrowing costs"", and she asked whether Chancellor Rachel Reeves was planning to raise taxes in a March mini-budget.

Defending his chancellor, the prime minister said the government's fiscal rules were ""iron clad"", and the government ""can't just tax and spend our way out of [the] problems"".

And he said Reeves would be chancellor for ""many, many years to come"".

Recent market turbulence has meant the cost of servicing UK debt has risen, and the last few days have seen pressures on the public finances increase, after government borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years.

Attacking the Conservatives as ""economic vandals and fantasists"", Sir Keir said his focus was on growth.

""They flatlined the economy and left us with the worst cost of living crisis in living history and a £22bn black hole, so I won't be taking lesson on the economy from them,"" he said.

Badenoch said the Office for Budget Responsibility ""found no such black hole"" and said two-thirds of businesses have complained they will need to raise prices as a result of Labour's first budget, which raised national insurance costs for employers.

""The prime minister claims he has full confidence in [Rachel Reeves] but the markets clearly do not,"" she said, adding: ""Labour congratulated themselves in having the first female chancellor, instead of ensuring they had somebody who was qualified for the job.""

The Conservative leader also highlighted that the PM has lost two ministers in as many months, with the resignation of city minister Tulip Siddiq, and the resignation of transport minister Louise Haigh at the end of November due to an historic fraud conviction.

Sir Keir dismissed Badenoch's insults as ""cheap political points"" and compared the resignations to the actions of the current Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, who remained in post as home secretary despite being found to have breached the ministerial code.

And he delivered his own barb at the Tories' former leader Liz Truss, who sent the PM a letter demanding Labour stop claiming she ""crashed the economy"" as it was damaging her reputation.

Sir Keir said: ""It wasn't written in green ink but it might as well have been.

Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.

It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.

But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.

The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.

She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.

But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.

Getting there is tricky.

Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.

As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.

She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – ""Mr She believes in making a green city,"" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.

At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.

Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. ""Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,"" they told us. And what about the businesses? ""Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.""

However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.

Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that ""online businesses"" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.

Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.

The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.

Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.

We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.

Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.

""The target is the elderly,"" she said. ""You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.""

Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.

""When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,"" she says. ""The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.""

During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.

Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border.

We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.

""I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,"" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held.

Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him.

Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind.

Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China.

This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas.

He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.

In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe.

Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (£12.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world.

China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar.

In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.

She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.

He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.

While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to ""a high probability"" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.

""Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.""

It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city.

It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here.

With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly.

Yatai's strategy is ""to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city"", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko.

He says they may even ""begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones"".

But he doesn't think the plan will work: ""What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.""

When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down.

Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty.

The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around.

The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.

It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us – not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said.

The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them.

We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty.

The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam.

They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there.

They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down.

Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.

In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young protégé, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.

Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. ""We are just property developers,"" he said. ""I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here.

""But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.""

But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border.

Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.

Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.

It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.

Neither do recent headlines.

Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him.

Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed.

The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko.

Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said.

They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth.

That distinction hasn't helped She Zhijiang, who once had the ear of politicians, police bosses and even minor royalty in Thailand. Today he appears to have lost even the influence he once had in prison, to buy himself special privileges. He has complained of being roughed up by the guards.

His lawyers are appealing against the Interpol red notice used to justify his arrest, but China's voice will probably be loudest in determining his fate.

From our interview with him, Shi Zhijiang seemed genuinely outraged over his sudden reversal of fortune.

""Before, I had no understanding of human rights, but now I really understand how horrible it is to have human rights infringed upon,"" he said.

""It is hard to imagine how the human rights of ordinary people in China are trampled upon when a respected businessman like me, who used to be able to go to the same state banquets as Xi Jinping, does not have his human rights and dignity protected in any way.""

It seems he really did believe he could build something which would one day transcend Shwe Kokko's sordid origins as a scam city.

https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268986/trump-humanitarian-parole-immigration,2025-01-21T04:48:35Z,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is slashing a program that was used by the Biden administration to temporarily allow the entrance of more than half a million migrants fleeing Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

In an executive order signed Monday evening, Trump instructed the Department of Homeland Security to ""terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders,"" including the humanitarian parole program for those four countries.

""One of my most important obligations is to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement,"" Trump said in the order. ""My Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to stop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States.""

Nearly 30,000 migrants had been granted the temporary stay each month since January 2023.

It's unclear what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people currently living with humanitarian parole.

The Biden administration paused the program due to fraud concerns. In October, it decided not to renew the legal status of those under the program, saying migrants would have to find a different path for legal status once their parole expires.

Biden's initiative allowed migrants from those embattled countries to apply for entry from their countries due to ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,"" without having to attempt to cross illegally outside a port of entry. A U.S.-based sponsor and a background check were required to apply.

Once approved, migrants were allowed to stay in the country for up to two years, get a work permit and be shielded from deportations.

Since 2023, 531,690 people have been granted humanitarian parole, according to DHS. The majority have come from Haiti.

https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/four_plead_guilty_in_us/,2025-01-15T12:36:24Z,"Four defendants have pleaded guilty in a US government IT procurement fraud case, which prosecutors claim has cost taxpayers at least $1.3 million in losses.

In the District of Maryland, a government official and an IT contractor were among those who admitted to charges relating to their roles in bid-rigging schemes. These involved bribery connected with the sale of IT products and services to the federal government, including the Department of Defense (DoD).

In November last year, government tech contractor Brandon Scott Glisson and federal official Lawrence Eady [PDF] pleaded guilty to separate counts of bribery. Prosecutors said Glisson bribed Eady with $630,000 from his company, Alpha Greatness Omega (AGO) in exchange for a promise that the US government would purchase IT products from one of their co-conspirators' companies at artificially inflated, non-competitive prices. According to the US Justice department, the scheme ran between August 2019 and October 2020. The inflated chunk of the price was then paid to AGO, which Glisson used for personal luxury purchases and to fund the bribes, prosecutors said.

Among the first guilty pleas in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into IT manufacturers, distributors and resellers selling to US government included that of Antwann Rawls, an on-site government IT consultant, and Scott Reefe, an IT sales executive.

Earlier this month, Reefe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while Rawls pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States.

Prosecutors allege that between 2018 and May 2019 (at a minimum), Rawls, Reefe, and others involved attained confidential procurement information, including procurement budgets for large US government IT contracts. They then used inside information to rig bids for government IT contracts at artificially determined, non-competitive and non-independent prices, ensuring one of their co-conspirators’ companies would win the contracts, the complaint alleges. Government estimates suggest that the cost to the US public purse was at least $1,300,000 in losses.

In a statement, acting assistant attorney general Doha Mekki of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said: ""These convictions bring to justice individuals who cheated and defrauded the United States government for their own personal gain. Holding these individuals accountable shows that rigging bids for government contracts will not go unnoticed or unpunished.""

Sentencing hearings are due to be set at a later date. Those pleading guilty face anything between five and 20 years in prison.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c805lpz35n1o,2025-01-14T02:57:00Z,"The special prosecutor who led a years-long investigation into Joe Biden's son, Hunter, has criticised the president for making ""baseless accusations"" about the case and defended his investigation in a final report.

In the report, released Monday, David Weiss called his prosecution of the president's son on gun and tax crimes ""impartial"" and ""not partisan politics"".

Hunter Biden's lawyer said the report showed Mr Weiss's investigation ""was a cautionary tale of the abuse of prosecutorial power.""

Biden issued an official pardon for his son, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, in early December.

While issuing the pardon, the president said his son had been ""singled out"" and called his cases ""a miscarriage of justice"" and ""raw politics"".

Mr Weiss called those statements ""gratuitous and wrong"".

""I prosecuted the two cases against [Hunter] Biden because he broke the law,"" he wrote in his report.

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June.

His father's full and unconditional pardon for his son came after the president had repeatedly said he would not give him clemency.

It was not the first time a US president has pardoned a family member.

Bill Clinton pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a 1985 cocaine-related offence in 2001.

In 2020, Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter, Ivanka, who pled guilty to federal charges of tax evasion and illegal campaign donation payments in 2005.

In his report, Mr Weiss acknowledged that, but added: ""none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations"".

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine counts of federal tax fraud in September, for which he had been facing up to 17 years in prison.

He was also convicted of three felonies in connection with a gun purchase in June, for which he had been facing up to 25 years in prison.

The investigations into the president's son had resurfaced uncomfortable and embarrassing details about his personal life, including his addiction to crack-cocaine and alleged payments to escorts.

President Biden had mostly kept quiet during the investigations into his son but came fiercely to his defence in his pardoning.

""There has been an effort to break Hunter - who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,"" President Biden said.

""In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me - and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""

He added: ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.""

The pardon covers the period from 1 January 2014 to 1 December 2024, ""including but not limited to"" the tax and gun crimes for which he was found guilty.

Mr Weiss said due to that unconditional pardon, he could not make any ""additional charging decisions"" relating to Hunter Biden over that period.

""It would be inappropriate to discuss whether additional charges are warranted,"" he said.

Mr Weiss has previously defended his inquiry into the president's son.

In 2023, he told the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee there had never been political pressure or interference in his work from the justice department.

Mr Weiss's investigation into Hunter Biden was heavily scrutinised on both sides of the political spectrum.

Democrats said it was politically charged and felt that Hunter Biden had an unfair target on his back.

Republicans believed the justice department was not pursuing charges aggressively enough and showing the president's son unfair favouritism.

Hunter Biden's guilty convictions came after a collapsed plea deal in 2023.

A judge declined to approve the deal - which Republicans had branded a ""sweetheart deal"" - that would have had Hunter Biden plead guilty to the tax evasion charges to avoid the more serious gun-related charges.

In a statement released Monday, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, criticised Mr Weiss for the failed deal.

U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb gave Ohtani's former interpreter a 57-month sentence and three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay nearly $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS.

""I want to say I am truly sorry to Mr. Ohtani for what I have done,"" Mizuhara, 40, said in court.

Mizuhara was ordered to surrender to authorities to begin serving his sentence by March 24. His attorney, Michael G. Freedman, said he expects Mizuhara, a Japanese citizen, to be deported at a later date.

""The magnitude of the theft -- $17 million -- in my view, is shockingly high,"" Holcomb said upon issuing the sentence.

Holcomb said most people don't make that much money in their lifetime.

""I hope that Mr. Mizuhara will be able to repay that sum,"" Holcomb said. ""That remains to be seen.""

Ohtani's attorneys and spokesperson did not respond to ESPN's request for comment.

The Dodgers fired Mizuhara in March after an ESPN investigation revealed that he had sent millions in wire transfers from Ohtani's account to an illegal bookmaker. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return in June, admitting that he placed about 19,000 bets with the bookie over a two-year period and accumulated over $40 million in debt.

""Mr. Mizuhara had a unique position of trust that gave him power, brought him fame, and paid him well,"" Joseph T. McNally, acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California, said in a news release. ""Unfortunately, he exploited this dream job to steal millions of dollars from his friend and confidant. This is a sad tale of an American success story gone wrong -- so wrong that Mr. Mizuhara will be spending years inside a prison cell.""

After the hearing, McNally said outside the courthouse that Ohtani is the victim in this case.

Prosecutors recommended a 57-month sentence, while Mizuhara's lawyer asked for an 18-month sentence, citing a long-standing gambling addiction. But in a court filing, prosecutors said there was ""only minimal evidence"" that Mizuhara had gambled before he began stealing from Ohtani.

""Mr. Mizuhara's addiction was drastic,"" Freedman said in court. ""Astronomical sums were involved.""

Freedman said Mizuhara's gambling addiction was ""inflamed"" because of the huge amount of credit the bookie gave him, knowing Mizuhara worked for Ohtani.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Mitchell told the court that when Mizuhara began stealing from Ohtani in 2021, the Japanese superstar earned $250,000 at the Los Angeles Angels.

""Mizuhara stole almost half of everything Ohtani made with the Angels,"" Mitchell said.

https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/24/north_korean_devs_and_their/,2025-01-24T13:45:09Z,"The US is indicting yet another five suspects it believes were involved in North Korea's long-running, fraudulent remote IT worker scheme – including one who changed their last name to ""Bane"" and scored a gig at a tech biz in San Francisco.

Two North Korean nationals residing in China, Jin Sung-Il and Pak Jin-Song, are among the indicted, accused of carrying out various jobs for numerous US companies, all facilitated by three others running so-called laptop farms.

Mexican national Pedro Ernesto Alonso De Los Reyes, who lives in Sweden, and US nationals Erick Ntekereze Prince and Emanuel Ashtor, of New York and North Carolina respectively, were also charged for facilitating the scheme.

Alonso is accused of willfully allowing the North Korean devs to use his genuine identity to create fake US worker visa documents, while Prince and Ashtor are alleged to have registered and run Taggcar and Vali Tech respectively – two US staffing companies used to secure employment for remote contractors.

Prosecutors claim the scheme ran for quite some time. The indictment [PDF] alleges that all five individuals, along with others not included in the charges, started the scheme as early as April 2018 and ran it until around August 2024.

The US claims Prince and Ashtor set up the laptops issued by the victimized US companies and unlawfully downloaded remote access software like AnyDesk and Teamviewer, allegedly allowing the likes of Jin, Pak, and others to remotely connect to and work for the US companies in IT roles. These were mainly mobile app developer gigs, but also involved what the indictment describes as ""specialist engineer positions.""

Unspecified members of the scheme also established US bank accounts to receive payments from salaries, which in some cases were well in excess of six figures, as well as accounts at other payment platforms used to launder the funds, minus the share allegedly taken by Alonso and Prince, the DoJ claims.

At least 64 US companies were successfully fooled by the scheme over the six-year period, the indictment states. Payments made by just ten of these orgs totaled approximately $866,255.

Only nine of the victim companies were described in any detail:

One is a multinational retail corporation based in the US

Another was a financial institution based in Stamford, CT

A Miami-based international cruise line

A San Francisco tech biz

Two IT companies based in Palo Alto and Milpitas, CA

Three staffing companies based in Illinois, California, and Florida

These companies were victimized in different ways, sometimes simultaneously. In one example shared in the indictment, Jin allegedly secured employment at the Illinois staffing company and signed documents with the Palo Alto IT company regarding confidentiality and care for the company-issued device.

Another saw Jin allegedly secure employment at the Stamford financial institution and, months later, a second job at the San Francisco tech company. After securing the job in Stamford, Jin informed the company he changed his family name to ""Bane,"" the persona he then used to secure a job in San Francisco, according to the indictment.

""The Department of Justice remains committed to disrupting North Korea's cyber-enabled sanctions-evading schemes, which seek to trick US companies into funding the North Korean regime's priorities, including its weapons programs,"" said Devin DeBacker, supervisory official at the Justice Department's National Security Division.

""Our commitment includes the vigorous pursuit of both the North Korean actors and those providing them with material support. It also includes standing side-by-side with US companies to not only disrupt ongoing victimization, but also to help them independently detect and prevent such schemes in the future.""

Prince and Ashtor were both arrested by the FBI at an unspecified time. Ashtor's residence in North Carolina was searched and law enforcement officials said it was previously used to host the laptop farm.

Alonso was also arrested earlier this month, on January 10 in the Netherlands, following an arrest warrant issued by the US. There was no word mentioned of whether he had yet been extradited.

All five individuals are charged and face counts related to conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to transfer false identification documents.

Additionally, Jin and Pak are charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Being based in China, the likelihood of them being seen in a US courthouse is slim, although if by chance that does happen, they'll face a maximum sentence of 20 years.

FBI hunts better, North Korea gets nastier

Coinciding with the Thursday indictment, the FBI updated its previous guidance on North Korean IT worker tradecraft, saying the fraudsters' tactics have become more aggressive of late.

After securing employment, the FBI said these workers were caught stealing proprietary data, including code, and extorting the employer for a ransom payment. Some cases have led to this data being published online, it added.

While it's not uncommon for software developers to copy company code to their personal GitHub accounts, the practice is seen as a major risk in the case of the North Korean schemes.

There are growing fears that these workers could take their tradecraft further, stealing genuine credentials and session cookies to facilitate additional types of compromise.

Commenting on the news, Michael Barnhart, principal analyst at Mandiant, said: ""The increased pressure from law enforcement and media coverage on North Korea's elaborate IT worker scheme is impacting the success of their operations. However, an unfortunate byproduct of law enforcement action is these threat actors are becoming noticeably more aggressive in their tactics.

""We are increasingly seeing North Korean IT workers infiltrating larger organizations to steal sensitive data and follow through on their extortion threats against these enterprises. It's also unsurprising to see them expanding their operations into Europe to replicate their success, as it's easier to entrap citizens who aren't familiar with their ploy.""

Barnhart also said Mandiant, which previously shared its top tips on catching North Korean IT miscreants, is seeing a rise in them specifically targeting companies that rely on virtual desktop infrastructure instead of providing their remote employees with physical hardware.

While it's more cost-effective for companies, and eliminates the need for laptop farms, ""it's easier for the threat actors to hide their malicious activity,"" he said.

https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/03/two_psni_officers_arrested_bailed/,2025-02-03T11:46:06Z,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has bailed two officers after they were arrested as part of a fraud investigation related to the payments to cops whose sensitive data was mistakenly published in 2023.

The personal data of 9,483 officers and staff members was exposed online for two hours in August 2023 following a botched response to a Freedom of Information request made by a member of the public. All of the 9,483 officers were offered £500 ($615) to be spent on shoring up their own personal security out of fear for their safety. Around 90 percent of these offers were accepted.

Police's data is considered especially sensitive in Northern Ireland, where many officers never reveal their job or role, even to family members, because of the tension with local Irish nationalists who do not believe the region should be under British control.

The PSNI's Anti-Corruption Unit is now looking into fraudulent activity related to those payments made to officers. The service didn't respond to The Register's request for more details about what that fraud entailed.

Bobby Singleton, deputy chief constable at the PSNI, said in a statement: ""The August 2023 data breach had a significant impact on many of our officers, staff, and their families.

""From the outset, we sought to provide them with the best possible support. The 'universal offer' of £500 per officer/staff member was intended to allow officers and staff to take practical steps to provide security and reassurance to them and their families. Ninety percent of officers and staff took up this offer of financial support.

""Following an investigation by our Anti-Corruption Unit on January 29, 2025, two officers have been arrested, interviewed, and bailed for fraud offenses relating to the universal offer.

""Concurrent misconduct investigations have also commenced and the duty status of both officers is, in line with police regulations, now being considered.

""The public rightly expect and demand the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all of our police officers and staff.

""When the actions of individuals are suspected to fall short of these standards, it seriously undermines legitimacy, trust, and public confidence in policing.

""In these cases, we will always seek to move swiftly and ensure an effective investigation to restore and maintain public confidence.

""As there is an ongoing investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.""

Commissioner Pete O'Doherty of the City of London Police previously described PSNI's data protection flub as ""the most significant data breach that has ever occurred in the history of UK policing.""

A review of the incident was published three months later, revealing an undisclosed number of PSNI officers had to relocate out of safety fears, while many more wanted to but didn't have the financial means to do so. The PSNI originally said that no officers were being relocated.

Some police officers even sought help from the service to legally change their names, although the review noted the PSNI told these officers they were taking an unnecessary step.

Why relocate?

The actions taken by some officers in the wake of the data's publication may seem extreme to someone without an understanding of the region's politics.

For decades in the 1900s, Northern Ireland was marred by ethno-nationalist conflict that was eventually ended, largely, by the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The history still lives fresh in the memory of the country's citizens, however, and periodic violence is still observed in modern times.

Many of the officers and staff whose data was published didn't take such drastic action, although the PSNI's health and well-being services were acutely affected.

15 January 2025

Matt Precey

BBC News, Northamptonshire

Five men have been charged with fraud related to a multimillion-pound loan to a League One football club.

The former chairman of Northampton Town FC, David Cardoza, is accused alongside his father Anthony, property developer Howard Grossman and his son Marcus and another man, Simon Patnick.

It follows a nine-year police investigation into the apparent disappearance of more than £10m loaned to the club by the then Northampton Borough Council.

The five are due to appear at Northampton Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

The men face fifteen charges between them:

Anthony Cardoza, 80, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, is accused of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position.

David Cardoza, 54, from Eastbourne, Sussex, is accused of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation, fraud by abuse of position and transferring criminal property.

Howard Grossman, 63, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, has been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation alongside four counts of removing criminal property and a charge of acquiring criminal property.

Marcus Grossman, 37, from London, is alleged to have committed fraud by false representation and transferred criminal property.

Simon Patnick, 54, from Stanmore, London, has also been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and acquiring criminal property.

Each man is accused of conspiring to make false representations to the council that the loan money would be used for the sole purpose of developing Northampton Town FC's Sixfields Stadium and an adjoining hotel.

It is alleged they knew this was ""untrue or misleading"" and that the men were ""intending to make a gain for themselves"", the charges state.

David and Anthony Cardoza have also been charged with fraud by abuse of position, which relates to a sum of £8.75m being paid from the football club to 1st Land Limited, a company owned by Howard Grossman.

It is more than nine years since Northamptonshire Police began Operation Tuckhill - its investigation into the apparent disappearance of the loan money, which was passed on to the club in order to develop a new stand and a hotel.

The East Stand remained half built for 10 years and is only now being completed.

The force said the alleged theft from Northampton Borough Council was only one element of a much wider investigation which has, over the past nine years, ""seen almost 1,000 witness statements taken and 4,719 exhibits logged by the specialist team set up in the wake of the initial police raids on the football stadium in November 2015"".

In a statement, Northampton Town FC acknowledged ""the recent statement from Northamptonshire Police regarding the previous owners of the club back in 2015"".

It continued: ""The club were always aware of the ongoing investigation and - in terms of the club now - it is obviously historic in nature.""

The 53-year-old victim, who gave her name as Anne, forked out 830,000 euros ($851,355) to help with what she believed was cancer treatment for the Hollywood legend.

A scammer managed to do so by convincing Anne they were Brad Pitt with a series of AI-generated images.

The interior designer told French channel TF1 that the ordeal started when she received a message on social media from someone claiming to be Brad's mother after sharing photos of her fancy ski trip to Tignes on Instagram.

A day later, another account posing as the Hollywood heartthrob sent a second message, saying his mother had spoken a lot about her already.

The victim, who noted she was going through a difficult period with her millionaire husband, said she struck up an unlikely friendship with the account from February 2023, receiving poems and sweet affirmations.

""There are so few men who write you this kind of thing. I liked the man I was talking to. He knew how to talk to women, it was always very well done,"" she said, as reported by BFMTV.

While Anne admitted she did have her suspicions that the account was fake, after messaging every day and receiving AI-generated photos and videos of the star, she became more at ease.

Soon Anne's online relationship with 'Bad Pitt' went to the next level when the person behind the account proposed to her and overwhelmed her with the promise of fancy gifts.

The only catch was that she would need to pay customs fees to receive them, which quickly added up to 9,000 euros ($9231).

With Anne already showing a willingness to part with large sums of money, the scammer went on to make increasingly absurd requests.

When the victim told 'Bad Pitt' that she was expecting a hefty divorce settlement from her husband, the scammer saw this as the perfect opportunity to up the ante with their requests.

The Brad Pitt account went on to appeal for help in funding urgent kidney cancer treatment, claiming that they could not access funds due to their ongoing divorce from Angelina Jolie.

The scammer reportedly then began sending AI-generated photos of the World War X star from the confines of a hospital bed.

Anne pointed out that while she and the scammer communicated by text and with photos, she said he was never free for a call - a common motif among online scammers.

In the end, she parted ways with nearly one million euros throughout the relationship until her suspicions were confirmed when she saw pics of the actor with his new girlfriend, Ines de Ramon.

Anne went to the authorities with the story, who launched an investigation.

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in ""immense distress and pain"".

Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode.

After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud.

She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house.

Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing ""severe emotional and physical distress and harm"". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said.

However, Insp Dalton said the child was now ""safe and doing well"".

The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said.

But one Washington pastor decided his own church flock was an appropriate place to start fleecing, according to the US Department of Justice.

The DoJ has charged Francier Obando Pinillo, the former pastor of a church in Pasco, Washington state, with 26 counts of fraud. So says an official press release issued last week and spotted by Bleeping Computer. According to the assistant district attorneys charging Pinillo, he sold his “Solano Fi” cryptocurrency to his parishioners both in person and on social media from 2021 to 2023, promising them a 34.9 percent return on investment with “no risk whatsoever.”

Pinillo allegedly claimed that the idea for the cryptocurrency “had come to him in a dream,” but funneled the investments into his own accounts and those of his co-conspirators, while showing his victims fake balances and returns via a mobile investment app. The DoJ alleges that victims were told to share the investment scam with others, and when suspicions of foul play were raised, Pinillo offered to “repair” the technical systems with more money or buy out their positions by replacing them with another investor.

Pinillo is charged with defrauding over a thousand victims both inside his own church and elsewhere of 5.9 million dollars. If convicted he could serve up to 20 years in prison.

Hino Motors (TM+0.56%), a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, has agreed to plead guilty and pay over $1.6 billion as part of a settlement with several U.S. agencies over an emissions fraud scheme.

The Japanese automaker was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud in U.S. federal court in Detroit for unlawfully selling more than 105,000 heavy-duty diesel engines into the U.S. between 2010 and 2022 that failed to meet emission standards, according to court documents. It made about $1.087 billion from its actions.

The misconduct first came to light in March 2022, when employees were revealed to have tampered with test results on engines used in more than 643,000 vehicles, including tens of thousands subject to a recall. Toyota removed Hino from a major Japanese truck consortium, and four officials, including three executives overseeing production and compliance, resigned.

A committee commissioned to investigate the scandal blamed it on an environment in which workers were forced to meet a strict pace of work and engineers felt they couldn’t challenge their bosses. A poor work environment was also found at Toyota’s Daihatsu subsidiary as part of an investigation into its recent safety scandal that tormented the Japanese auto industry last year.

“Hino’s actions led to vast amounts of excess air pollution and were an egregious violation of our nation’s environmental, consumer protection and import laws,” Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim said in a statement.

As part of its agreement to resolve multiple civil and criminal allegations, Hino agreed to plead guilty to engaging in a multi-year conspiracy and serve a five-year probation, during which it will be prevented from importing diesel engines into the U.S. The deal is awaiting approval by a federal judge in Michigan.

Hino ran afoul of several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the FBI, and the Department of Transportation, along with the state of California. The settlement includes a criminal penalty of $521.76 million, $442.5 million in civil penalties, and $236.5 million to resolve claims brought by California.

In October, Hino booked a loss $230 billion yen, or about $1.54 billion, to cover the expected costs.

“This resolution is a significant milestone toward resolving legacy issues that we have worked hard to ensure are no longer a part of Hino’s operations or culture,” Hino CEO Satoshi Ogiso said in a statement, adding that the automaker has enacted several company-wide reforms to prevent future misconduct.

Joey Grant Luther, 54, was charged with wire fraud, smuggling, and other crimes related to the purchase and import of misbranded and counterfeit drugs at his medical spa, JGL Aesthetics, located in New York City's Hell's Kitchen. None of the Botox was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, prosecutors said.

""As alleged, Joey Grant Luther, who does not possess the licensing required by New York State to perform injections of Botox, knowingly purchased counterfeit Botox from China, injected it into his clients, and represented that the counterfeit Botox that he was peddling was genuine,"" U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said in a statement.

Luther allegedly continued to purchase and inject the counterfeit Botox despite knowing clients had fallen ill or experienced strange symptoms, Sassoon said. He allegedly reassured his patients that any side effects were temporary and that the Botox was from Allergan, the veritable maker, according to prosecutors.

""Luther's disregard for the health of his clients put all of his victims in harm's way and, in some cases, caused life-threating injuries,"" Sassoon said.

According to the criminal complaint, an investigation began after one of Luther's patients said they experienced double vision, heart palpitations, weakness from the waist up and other problems after receiving a Botox injection from JGL Aesthetics. The victim visited three hospitals to treat the symptoms and was diagnosed with Botulism toxin in March 2024, prosecutors said.

Customs and Border Protection intercepted parcels intended for JGL Aesthetics, finding one that contained ""significant quantities of counterfeit drugs, including counterfeit Botox,"" according to prosecutors.

Luther was scheduled to be presented late Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Cave. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.

It is unclear if Luther has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2025/01/28/customers-pay-the-price-of-policy-abuse-the-state-of-ecommerce-fraud/,2025-01-28T15:00:00Z,"Lax return policies and lenient fraud prevention measures are fueling a surge in ecommerce fraud, ultimately burdening consumers with higher prices and diminished trust in online shopping.

Ecommerce has transformed the shopping experience, turning living rooms into fitting rooms and checkout counters into a few clicks. But with this convenience comes a cost, and not just for retailers. On average, retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales in 2024 will be returned, and total returns for the retail industry are projected to reach $890 billion in 2024. Fraudulent and abusive practices surrounding returns, refunds, and exchanges now amount to a staggering $394 billion annual expense for retailers globally. Of this, at least $28 billion is lost directly to fraud and abuse, an issue becoming ever more sophisticated, according to a new report from Riskified titled “Returns, Refunds & Exchanges: Global Insights & Policy Playbook 2024.”

The real kicker? Honest customers are paying the price. Retailers are tightening once-generous policies to curb losses, leaving both legitimate and fraudulent shoppers feeling the pinch.

The Monster Merchants Created

The ecommerce boom of the pandemic era was a perfect storm of generosity. Retailers, in a bid to win over hesitant online shoppers, rolled out the red carpet: free returns, instant refunds, and no-questions-asked exchanges. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey found that at least 50% of demographics, including Americans over 18, Millennials, Gen-X, and Boomers find flexible return policies very important.

While this approach fostered customer loyalty, it also opened a kind of retailer Pandora's box. Fraudsters and policy abusers quickly identified opportunities to exploit loopholes faster than retailers could address them.

Indeed, the sophistication of abuse has skyrocketed. Riskified’s report says that more than 84% of merchants admit identifying fraudulent activity has become harder, while 76% say policy abuse is growing increasingly sophisticated.

What makes this problem particularly insidious is the advanced technological tools now available to fraudsters. ""Generosity is a double-edged sword in ecommerce,"" says Eido Gal, CEO of Riskified. ""What makes for a great customer experience also provides opportunities for fraudsters Factors like the Dark Web and malicious AI tools have turned return fraud into a highly efficient operation.""

Forums on the Dark Web offer “Fraud-as-a-Service” kits, while malicious AI tools like WormGPT automate scams that previously required manual effort. These tools empower even novice fraudsters to exploit systems with precision.

""Fraudsters are no longer operating in isolation. They exchange strategies and adjust in real time, making it incredibly challenging for retailers to stay ahead,"" says Gal.

Good Customers Are Paying the Price

It’s easy to dismiss this as a retailer problem, but the truth is, everyone bears the cost. Fraudsters steal more than products—they siphon away resources that could improve customer experiences. Worse still, peak shopping seasons see an uptick in fraudulent activity, as consumers overlook small, fraudulent charges on their credit cards amidst holiday spending.

Surprisingly, even middle-aged, middle-class shoppers—far from the archetype of a fraudster—are complicit. According to Riskified, these individuals justify policy abuse as a victimless crime, citing financial pressures and an ""everyone's doing it"" mentality.

Gal points out the far-reaching consequences: ""This normalization of abuse erodes trust between merchants and consumers. It forces retailers to implement stricter measures, which ultimately penalize honest shoppers.""

Underlining all of this is the simple fact that policy abuse is inherently tricky to identify. Fraudulent claims often resemble legitimate ones, forcing merchants to sift through vast amounts of data. The internal complexity—spanning customer service, logistics, and finance—further complicates the task. According to a Riskified report, 67% of merchants struggle with inadequate collaboration between departments, leading to silos that fraudsters are quick to exploit.

The End of Generous Policies

Retailers are shifting away from the “generous at all costs” philosophy and adopting a more pragmatic approach to safeguarding profits. Policies are shifting rapidly, as Riskified’s findings reveal. One-third of retailers now impose fees for returns, a move designed to offset the financial drain of reverse logistics. This may be forcing nearly 70% of all demographics to attempt in-store returns, according to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey

Similarly, another third of merchants have replaced refunds with store credit or exchange-only policies to retain revenue within their ecosystem. Additionally, two in five online retailers have significantly reduced their refund window to just seven days, a stark contrast to the 30-day standard still common in physical stores, underscoring the industry’s efforts to tighten operational controls.

While these changes help curb abuse, they also risk alienating loyal customers. “Striking the balance between security and service is the crux of this challenge,” Gal notes. “Retailers must protect their bottom line without undermining customer trust.”

Fighting Back: The Identity-Based Approach

For retailers to regain control, they must adopt more sophisticated, identity-driven strategies. By analyzing the individual behind each transaction, merchants can differentiate between loyal customers, occasional abusers, and outright fraudsters. This nuanced approach enables businesses to mitigate losses without alienating their best customers.

Riskified advocates several measures to help retailers combat policy abuse effectively while maintaining strong customer relationships. Leveraging AI and automation enables businesses to identify patterns of abuse and streamline decision-making processes with greater precision. Enhancing data transparency by breaking down silos between departments ensures that customer insights are shared effectively, enabling a more cohesive approach to fraud prevention.

Implementing tailored policies, such as sliding-scale return options based on customer loyalty and purchase history, strikes a balance between protecting profits and rewarding loyal customers.

Finally, focusing resources on customer service excellence enables retailers to deliver standout experiences to their ideal customers while addressing instances of fraud discreetly and efficiently.

This approach, as Gal emphasizes, is about creating a win-win: ""We’re not just fighting fraud. We’re optimizing customer experiences. Merchants who master this balance will thrive in an increasingly competitive market.""

Toward a Sustainable Ecommerce Ecosystem

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Returns, refunds, and exchanges account for nearly 11% of global ecommerce revenue. Beyond the financial impact, unchecked policy abuse undermines trust—a cornerstone of customer loyalty. Gal emphasizes, “Fraud prevention isn’t just about minimizing losses; it’s about safeguarding the brand’s relationship with its customers.”

By leveraging technology and identity-driven strategies, retailers can outsmart fraudsters without compromising the customer experience. As Riskified’s research shows, the key to success is strategic, data-driven action. Only then can merchants transform policy abuse from a costly challenge into an opportunity to build stronger, more resilient customer relationships.",negative,negative,0.8804568648338318,positive,0.9810567200183868,negative,0.9977625608444214,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.8865897357463837, 0.17246371135115623, 0.009666974190622568]",negative,0.8865897357463837
https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/02/eurocops_takedown_cybercrime/,2025-02-02T13:19:07Z,"Law enforcement officers across Europe assembled again to collectively disrupt major facilitators of cybercrime, with at least one of those cuffed apparently a fan of the dramedy series The Gilmore Girls.

Two crime forums, Cracked and Nulled, were pulled offline.

Together, the platforms amassed more than 9 million users and were often budding e-miscreants' first foray into pursuing a life of cybercrime.

Similar to BreachForums, which was briefly taken down by law enforcement last year, Cracked and Nulled offered users a platform to discuss all things devious and a marketplace to sell their tools and ill-gotten wares.

The collective takedown action was led by German authorities in a campaign dubbed Operation Talent and took place between January 28-30.

It led to two arrests following the search of seven properties. Law enforcement seized 17 servers, 12 domains, 50 devices, and around €300,000 ($311,279) worth of cash and cryptocurrency tokens. Given that Cracked and Nulled generated millions in revenue, the amount seized is just a fraction - but still a notable disruption to their operations.

Lucas Sohn, a 29-year-old Argentine, was the only named suspect. A video released by Europol showed Sohn, who resides in Spain, being arrested and his devices combed through by the Guardia Civil. The video also showed the arrest of a second, unnamed individual.

It's not known whether the pair were complicit in running the services taken down by the police, although the video, which showed glimpses of their living quarters, showed two desks situated next to each other in a room decorated with various merchandise such as Pop figures, anime art, and TV show posters including one depicting the fictional town of Stars Hollow where the Gilmore Girls series is set.

Youtube Video

According to the US Justice Department, Sohn is being linked to the administration of Nulled – a platform used to sell login credentials, stolen identity documents, and various tools used for cybercrime and fraud. The platform has been in operation since 2016, has 5 million registered users, and is estimated to generate $1 million in annual revenue.

""According to the complaint, Sohn was an active administrator of Nulled and performed escrow functions on the website,"" said the Justice Department.

""Nulled's customers would use Sohn's services to complete transactions involving stolen credentials and other information.""

Sohn faces three charges in the US related to conspiracy to traffic in passwords, access device fraud, and identity fraud, which carry maximum possible sentences of five, ten, and 15 years respectively.

The Justice Department said Cracked had been on the scene since 2018 and raked in $4 million in the process. Its primary offering was a marketplace that offered access to stolen credentials, hacking tools, and servers to host malware and stolen data.

It added that around 17 million people from the US were victimized by the activity that took place on Cracked, citing a specific case from New York where a woman was cyber-stalked and sextorted.

The alleged criminal behind this campaign used a product advertised on Cracked that purportedly offered access to ""billions of leaked websites,"" allowing users to search for stolen login credentials, including the New York woman's.

Eight of Cracked's domains were seized and in doing so, investigators also found details of the site's payment processor, Sellix, and the StarkRDP bulletproof hosting provider, both of which were scuppered.

No named individual was arrested in connection to Cracked.

One particular tax scam is especially thorny since it can happen right under your nose. In an attempt to collect a refund, a fraudster files a tax return in your name. But you won’t know it until you go to file yourself and discover a mess to untangle. The risk of this happening is higher in 2025 too after last year’s repeated data breaches. At this point, most everyone’s personal information (including social security numbers) is findable somewhere on the dark web.

Fortunately, the IRS makes this kind of scam easy to block. On the agency’s website, you can request an identity protection PIN, a six-digit numeric string that you must add to your filing. It identifies your tax return as the legitimate one—if a filing lacks the PIN, it won’t count.

Previously, this program was only available to victims of identity theft, either by request or decision of the IRS. Now all taxpayers can voluntarily opt into the program.

PCWorld

To sign up, head to the IRS website. The quickest method for verification is through the government’s ID.me service, but you can also do so through mail or an in-person appointment. The online process takes about 15-20 minutes.

Identity protection PINs are good for only one year and can’t be reused. (A smart system, so that if a number is ever stolen or compromised after use, you’re not vulnerable to fraud again.) When voluntarily enrolling, you can choose to receive a PIN on a continual basis or just one time only. Most people will be best off automatically having the IRS send a new PIN each year—less to think about during an already hectic period. You can use your ID.me login to look up your PIN.

BBC News and File on 4 Investigates

It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.

And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.

Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.

""There has been tax evasion,"" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. ""This is criminal.""

In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had ""always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice"" and ""acted in accordance"" with it.

The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.

Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (£559m).

The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.

They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.

The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.

The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.

Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.

'Aware of the risks'

The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed ""Operating Structure"" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.

""We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,"" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.

Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected ""so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure"", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.

Mr Holloway warned them they should be ""aware of the risks"". He wrote: ""We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.""

Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate ""customer"" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any ""common link"" that might arouse suspicion.

As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.

Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.

'Hide the reality'

The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an ""artificial structure"" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.

""My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion… because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,"" he said.

Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme ""indications"" that they ""may be misrepresenting information"".

""If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,"" she added.

Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he ""joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time"".

He said he had ""managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world"". ""I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,"" he said, adding that he ""used structures others in the industry were using"".

Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied ""any allegation that he had any knowledge"" or was ""personally responsible"" or liable for ""any alleged deception of any government authority"" to evade tax.

His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that ""similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running"" of the companies involved in the scheme.

If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.

This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.

A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.

""At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,"" he wrote.

There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.

In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (£35,000) in tax.

In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.

A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.

This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial ""look"" of the operation was a sham.

'Lawyers got onto it'

Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.

Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.

Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.

But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and ""their lawyers got onto it"", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.

Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers ""produced documentation"" proving Pelorus was ""entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire"".

Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.

In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to €17m (£14.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be ""zero-rated"" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.

Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were ""unreasonable and oppressive"", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.

We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.

According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were ""engaged in economic activity"" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.

In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of €14m (£11.8m).

We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.

Publisher Tom Goldstein had announced that the site would be scaling back its coverage of the Court. SCOTUSBlog remains functional, but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as it used to be.

Today's news, however, may signal a real farewell to SCOTUSBlog.

Tom Goldstein was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on charges of tax evasion, willful failure to pay taxes, false statements, and other charges. The indictment contains some stunning allegations (of course Goldstein remains innocent until proven guilty):

6. In addition to the legal work he performed at G&R [Goldstein & Russell], GOLDSTEIN was also an ultrahigh-stakes poker player, frequently playing in matches or series of matches in the United States and abroad involving stakes totaling millions, and even tens of millions, of dollars. GOLDSTEIN's poker activities included both ""ring games"" (which typically involved five or more players) as well as ""heads-up"" matches (which were two-player matches). . . .

10. To make and receive payments related to his gambling and certain other private activities between 2016 and 2022, GOLDSTEIN typically used a personal bank account (''the Gambling Account"") over which he exercised exclusive control and authority, including the authority to effectuate transfers. The G&R firm managers did not have access to the Gambling Account. By contrast, GOLDSTEIN permitted the G&R firm managers to share authority with respect to the G&R bank accounts, as well as a different personal bank account for GOLDS1EIN and his wife, through which the G&R firm managers, as part of their official duties, paid certain of GOLDSTEIN's personal bills. . . .

24. Between 2016 and 2022, GOLDSTEIN engaged in a scheme to evade the assessment of taxes, file false tax returns, and fail to pay his tax obligations when they were due.

The allegations go on.

I do not have much to say about these substantive offenses. But I worry that this news may spell the end of SCOTUSBlog. Indeed, the indictment will seek criminal forfeiture of ""any property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the offenses."" Does SCOTUSBlog fall in that category? If so, I hope someone else acquires SCOTUSBlog. It would be a shame to lose this valuable resource.

Update: Shortly after my post went up, I received a statement from a rep for Goldstein:

Goldstein’s biography on the SCOTUSblog website says that he earned his undergraduate degree from UNC Chapel Hill and his law degree from American University’s Washington College of Law, as well as receiving an Honorary Doctorate from that institution.

His practice included arguing more than 40 cases at the Supreme Court, including a landmark copyright case, Google v. Oracle. Goldstein retired from appellate practice in 2023 from the law firm he founded, Goldstein & Russell; the firm subsequently rebranded as Goldstein, Russell & Woofter, with partners Kevin Russell and Daniel Woofter in charge.

The criminal charges relate to alleged actions before Goldstein’s retirement, taking place between 2016 and 2022, describing the attorney as an “ultrahigh-stakes poker player” who bet on games with “stakes totaling millions, and even tens of millions of dollars,” reported Law360’s Phillip Bantz. The indictment was filed in Maryland federal court, due to Goldstein’s law firm being located in Bethesda, and accuses him of conducting a scheme to “evade the assessment of taxes, file false tax returns and fail to pay his tax obligations when they were due.”

As the sole owner at the time of the law firm, Goldstein “allegedly used millions of dollars in funds” from the firm “to cover gambling debts and other personal debts and falsely understated his gambling winnings by millions of dollars in tax filings, according to the indictment,” wrote Bantz, adding additional scandalous accusations against the lawyer:

He also is accused of entering into sham employment arrangements with four women who he was in “intimate personal relationships with” or was pursuing. Goldstein allegedly listed the women as “employees” of his law firm, paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars and set them up with health insurance policies through the firm, while they “performed little or no work for the firm.”

The indictment says that Goldstein allegedly owes “substantial amounts of money to the IRS.”

Goldstein’s previous law firm has already rebranded again to Russell & Woofter LLC on its website, removing most mentions of Goldstein. Court filings and blog posts on the firm website show it was using the name “Goldstein, Russell & Woofter LLC” through 2024.

Law360 updated its original article “to clarify the number of women with whom Goldstein is accused of entering sham employment relationships,” and this article has also been updated accordingly.

UPDATE 5:45 pm ET: Trial counsel for Mr. Goldstein, John Lauro of Lauro & Singer and Christopher Kise of Continental, reached out to Mediaite with the following statement:

Mr. Goldstein is a prominent attorney with an impeccable reputation.

The United States Department of Justice announced, in April 2024, that Roger Keith Ver, known by his followers as ""Bitcoin Jesus,"" was indicted on fraud and tax-related charges, including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The indictment alleged that Ver, a former California resident who expatriated to St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, concealed assets and provided false information during the expatriation process to evade taxes, including an ""exit tax"" on his Bitcoin holdings. The press release from the Department of Justice claimed that Ver allegedly sold tens of thousands of Bitcoins without reporting or paying taxes on distributions from his U.S.-based companies causing a $48 million loss to the IRS. The United States sought Ver’s extradition from Spain to stand trial. On Dec. 3, 2024, Ver filed a motion to dismiss and on Jan. 13, 2025 the government filed its opposition. This is one of the first glimpses into cryptocurrency enforcement post-election where a friendlier regulatory and enforcement landscape has been promised.

On Jan. 16, 2025, a Maryland attorney was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 charges, including tax evasion, assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, failure to pay taxes, and making false statements to mortgage lenders. Thomas C. Goldstein retired from a prominent United States Supreme Court practice, according to an ABA Journal article, in 2023 indicating that the change in the Supreme Court made it difficult to fight for the little guy. Now he faces charges that, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, could result in decades in prison. Most of the allegations in the indictment involve omitting legal fee income, misreporting gambling winnings and debts, or are related to alleged “sham employment relationships” with several women the government claims were involved in intimate relationships with Goldstein. Amid the scandalous claims involving gambling, infidelity, and duffel bags of cash the indictment also claims Goldstein conducted 280 cryptocurrency transactions but answered “no” on his tax return about making any virtual currency transactions.

Can The DOJ Finally Reach Bitcoin Jesus?

In his motion to dismiss, Ver (a.k.a. Bitcoin Jesus), claimed the exit tax itself violated the constitution, that the legal standards involving cryptocurrency’s tax treatment were unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence used in the indictment was incomplete and that full versions show that Ver made every attempt to properly follow the tax laws. Many tax advisors, including this author, have struggled to answer difficult questions regarding digital assets when the limited IRS guidance doesn’t address the issues involved. Both the indictment and the motion to dismiss outline that Ver did, in fact, seek legal and tax advice during a time when little guidance was provided by the government.

In its opposition the governments first argument is for the court to ignore the motion to dismiss entirely until Ver is extradited under the “Fugitive Entitlement Doctrine.” Essentially, if you’re a fugitive you are not entitled to use of the courts for pre-trial claims such as Ver’s motion to dismiss. Since Ver didn’t actually flee the United States because of criminal prosecution (i.e. he had already expatriated years before) the government claims “constructive flight” and other equitable arguments to avoid a decision on the motion to dismiss. Perhaps assuming these equitable arguments might fail, the government addresses the merits as well. First, the United States claims that not all counts involve the exit tax so even if the exit tax is determined to be unconstitutional other counts remain. The government’s opposition then attacks Ver’s constitutional claims.

Ver’s constitutional arguments includes reliance on the recently decided Supreme Court ruling in Moore v. United States. According to Ver, unrealized appreciation in the value of an asset cannot be taxed as income and because the exit tax taxes this unrealized appreciation it is unconstitutional. The government responds that realization doesn’t determine constitutionality, and such a strict requirement would call into question numerous other taxes based on constructive sales. Ver’s remaining constitutional arguments rely on violations of due process and the vagueness of tax laws involving cryptocurrency. While there are legitimate complaints about lack of guidance and the hardships caused by the decision to expatriate, it remains to be seen if those concerns are sufficient to pass the legal standards required to make a law unconstitutional. At the very least, the arguments raise the questions about whether the government can use the threat of criminal proceedings on tax laws that are arguably lacking the required guidance for analysis on the proper tax treatment. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is currently set for Feb. 10, 2025.

Will Crypto Become Common In Criminal Tax Cases?

Unlike Ver, Goldstein is not alleged to be an early adopter of cryptocurrency. Although the indictment includes allegations from as far back as 2016, the claims regarding financial interests in cryptocurrency are only alleged for his 2020 and 2021 tax returns. Also, in Counts 13 and 14 of the indictment, it is alleged that Goldstein aided and assisted in the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return by answering “No” to the question asking if he had received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency. Previous criminal indictments for misreporting cryptocurrency transactions, like the indictment against Ver, involve earlier tax years when this question was not included on an individual tax return (IRS Form 1040).

The question regarding transactions in cryptocurrency first appeared on the IRS Form 1040 in 2019 but was included in Schedule 1 for that tax return. The 2020 version of IRS Form 1040, the first tax year at issue in the indictment, moved the question to a much more prominent spot, right after entering your name and address. A similar question about whether taxpayers had interests in foreign bank accounts was also contained in a Schedule to the Form 1040 and subsequent litigation called into question whether the question was affirmatively not answered or just overlooked. For criminal tax cases, this makes proving the key attribute of willfulness more problematic. Presumably, the IRS, knowing about this previous problem with foreign bank accounts, decided to move the virtual currency question to its more conspicuous place on the return.",negative,neutral,0.8222429156303406,negative,0.9121035039424896,neutral,0.9996767938137054,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.4683483690023422, 0.4325910285115242, 0.014022033894434571]",positive,0.4683483690023422

Todd Chrisley claims that he’s a victim of anti-MAGA discrimination.

Chrisley is currently behind bars serving a 12-year sentence on fraud and tax evasion charges.

And he claims that at least one guard has singled him out for mistreatment due to his support of President Donald Trump.

Todd Chrisley Claims He’s Being Victimized By Anti-Trump Guards

According to a new report from TMZ, Todd recently told his lawyer that an irate corrections officer removed a “Make America Great Again” sticker from a chair in his cell.

Chrisley alleged that other prisoners were allowed to keep the stickers in their cells.

The TMZ report claims that “Todd believes guards are against him because he supports Trump.”

The Truth of the Matter

Of course, it seems somewhat improbable that a bunch of Florida prison guards would be so vehemently anti-Trump that they would be willing to risk their jobs over it.

The more likely explanation here is that Todd is taking a page from Joe Exotic’s playbook and trying to score a pardon from Trump.

As you may recall, the Tiger King star was locked up on murder-for-hire charges back in 2019. He’s been appealing to Trump for a pardon ever since, but to no avail.

Now, Chrisley’s attorney, Jay Surgent, is angling for a pardon — but he probably won’t be any more successful.

The Case Against the Chrisleys

Todd and wife Julie Chrisley were both convicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to commit bank fraud in 2022.

And their lawyer is still insisting that the charges were bogus.

“Todd and his wife would like to be considered for pardon, but it will be up to President Trump to review their cases,” says Surgent.

“Todd has faith he will be given due consideration, because he feels that he never received constitutional protections in a fair criminal justice system.”

Chrisley’s daughter Savannah spoke at last year’s Republican National Convention, so Trump is probably aware of the family’s story.

But unless new evidence emerges in the Chrisleys’ favor, they’ll probably have to wait for the end of Trump’s term to receive a pardon.

Throughout his incarceration, Todd has made numerous allegations against FPC Pensacola and its guards.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons tells TMZ that it’s “committed to ensuring the safety and security of the individuals in our custody, our employees, and the public,” adding:

“Allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true, including the possibility of referral for criminal prosecution when appropriate.”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2025/01/23/7-criminal-charges-filed-in-massive-covid-related-tax-credit-scheme/,2025-01-23T14:30:37Z,"During and after the Covid-19 pandemic, the employee retention credit became a massive source of new business for many accountants and other tax professionals. But as has been widely reported for years, the IRS often pushed back on aggressive and downright bogus claims. There were also plenty of good faith interpretive questions, where taxpayers and their advisers believed they qualified for the credit but where the IRS said otherwise.

Some claims, though, were beyond the pale, and even have become criminal tax cases. Can a tax audit lead to serious criminal charges? In some cases yes. A case is point is a new federal indictment that charges seven individuals with operating a multi-state conspiracy to defraud the United States of more than $600 million via filing more than 8,000 false tax returns claiming Covid-19-related employment tax credits. The Department of Justice news release is here.

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic impact, Congress authorized a tax credit that incentivized businesses to keep employees on their payroll, also known as the “Employee Retention Credit” or ERC. Congress also authorized a credit that reimbursed businesses for the wages paid to employees who were on sick or family leave and could not work because of Covid-19. This “Paid Sick and Family Leave Credit,” or SFLC, was equal to the wages the business paid the employees during their leave.

The indictment alleges that from November 2021 to June 2023, defendants Keith Williams, Jamari Lewis, Morais Dicks, Janine Davis, Tiffany Williams, James Hames Jr. and Ewendra Mathurin, all current or former New York residents, repeatedly exploited these programs that were intended to help businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The scheme was allegedly headquartered at Credit Reset, a purported credit repair business that Keith Williams owned and operated. Acting as tax preparers, the defendants allegedly filed more than 8,000 false employment tax returns with the IRS claiming Covid-related tax credits on behalf of themselves and their clients.

Each of these tax returns were allegedly fraudulent in that they claimed SFLC in excess of the amount of wages reported on the tax return, listed the same wages as both qualified sick leave wages and qualified family leave wages or claimed the SFLC and ERC for the same wages, none of which was permitted by law. The defendants allegedly profited from the scheme by receiving tax refund checks from the U.S. Treasury and by charging clients a fee or a percentage of the tax refund the client received.

The defendants also allegedly recruited others into the scheme, who were compensated by receiving a percentage of fraudulently obtained U.S. Treasury checks. In total, the defendants sought more than $600 million of which the IRS paid approximately $45 million to the defendants and their clients.

The indictment claims that the defendants concealed their preparation of the false tax returns by not listing themselves as the paid preparer on the tax returns, and by using Virtual Private Networks to obscure their IP addresses while filing the false returns. For clients without a business, the indictment alleges, members of the conspiracy would sell shell companies to the clients in order to file false tax returns.

How was this ring uncovered? The indictment notes that after noticing discrepancies in the filed returns, the IRS and Social Security Administration allegedly requested additional information regarding the tax returns the defendants prepared. In response, members of the conspiracy allegedly would often transmit false information to the IRS and SSA. Some of the defendants also allegedly submitted false Paycheck Protection Program loan applications.

The defendants were charged with 45 counts relating to the scheme, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns. Keith Williams, Lewis, Mathurin, Davis, Tiffany Williams and Dicks were also charged with wire fraud in relation to fraudulent PPP applications they submitted.

Make no mistake, these are serious charges. If convicted, the defendants face very serious prison time:

A maximum penalty of five years in prison for the conspiracy to defraud the United States charge;

A maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud charge arising out of the ERC scheme;

A maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for each wire fraud charge arising out of the PPP fraud; and

A maximum penalty of three years in prison for each charge of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false return charge.

This is only an indictment, and the government must prove its case to obtain a conviction. But if the seven defendants are found guilty, the potential prison time is lengthy.",negative,negative,0.6207752823829651,negative,0.998457670211792,neutral,0.9871104657649994,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.7942562997341156, 0.5513987839221954, 0.010858786292374134]",negative,0.7942562997341156

https://decrypt.co/302967/bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-begs-trump-pardon,2025-01-27T20:35:20Z,"Crypto entrepreneur and alleged criminal Roger “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver is pleading with President Donald Trump for a pardon—but Trump confidant and Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said that Ver’s renounced U.S. citizenship makes that impossible.

Musk, the tech titan and close President Trump ally—not to mention noted Dogecoin fan and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE—said on X (formerly Twitter) Sunday that Ver would not get pardoned because of the move.

Ver, 46, is facing jail time after the feds last year charged him with avoiding paying $50 million in taxes, along with alleged mail fraud and filing false tax returns. He is now campaigning for President Trump’s help via social media posts.

“Roger Ver gave up his U.S. citizenship,” Musk, the world’s richest man, wrote on X. “No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges,” he added in response to an X user’s questions.

The topic of pardons is currently a hot one after President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise and last week released Silk Road founder and Bitcoin enthusiast Ross Ulbricht.

Ulbricht was serving two life terms plus 40 years without parole for running a dark web marketplace that was largely used to buy drugs via BTC. Libertarians, Bitcoiners, and the wider crypto community had lobbied the President to release Ulbricht, arguing that his sentence was too harsh.

Now Ver, one of the earliest investors in Bitcoin, is hoping for the same result from President Trump. On Sunday, he released a dramatic video begging the new commander in chief to clear his charges.

Ver did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s questions. On Monday, he released another clip—lasting 20 minutes—claiming that, “For decades, I’ve been terrorized by rogue U.S. government agents who hate American freedom.”

Crypto entrepreneur Ver earned the name “Bitcoin Jesus” because he used to give away the cryptocurrency for free when it was worth next to nothing, and heavily invested in the cryptosphere’s earliest companies.

But Ver switched to promoting Bitcoin spinoff Bitcoin Cash, and has since been trying to grow the coin. He claims Bitcoin Cash is the “real” Bitcoin, and has rubbed the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency’s community the wrong way with his aggressive marketing.

Ver, who served prison time in 2002 for selling explosives on eBay, renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis.

Feds nabbed Ver in Spain last year after U.S. authorities ordered his arrest, alleging that he sold Bitcoin in 2017 but had not informed the IRS about the gains he had made.",negative,negative,0.6985586285591125,neutral,0.9908474683761596,neutral,0.9976903200149536,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.7365253567695618, 0.7271076440811157, 0.008778026327490807]",negative,0.7365253567695618

Indian authorities made demand of USD 1.4 billion from Volkswagen Group

Volkswagen, the German automobile manufacturer, has initiated legal action against Indian authorities to contest a tax demand of USD 1.4 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore), as per a report by Reuters. The Indian arm of the automaker, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Pvt Ltd has reportedly told the Mumbai High Court that the tax dispute poses a risk to the OEMs investments of USD 1.5 billion in the country. Furthermore, it will hamper the brand's foreign investments.

It is to be noted that the Indian government issued a tax notice to the Volkswagen Group in September 2024 in the view of implementation of an import strategy to pay a lower duty. Specifically, the strategy enabled the brand to break down imports of Volkswagen, Audi, and Skoda cars into individual parts.

Indian authorities have accused the German brand of importing a car in an unassembled condition. This allegedly enabled the brand to import them as ""individual parts"" coming separate shipments resulting in payment of 5-15 percent tax. However, the brand was liable to pay 30-35 percent tax because the cars should have been classified as CKD (completely knocked down) units.

Defending itself in the court challenge, Volkswagen India said that it had kept the Indian government updates of its strategy of ""part-by-part import"". Furthermore, the brand claims that it had received clarifications in its support in 2011.

Volkswagen Group further says the tax notice is ""in complete contradiction of the position held by the government (and) places at peril the very foundation of faith and trust that foreign investors would desire to have in the actions and assurances"" of the administration, as per report.

According to Reuters, there has been no reply from the Ministry of Finance and the customs official who issued the demand order, and a spokesperson for Volkswagen in Germany also did not respond at the time the story was published.

The Indian branch of Volkswagen stated that it is utilizing all legal avenues as it collaborates with authorities and is dedicated to maintaining ""full compliance"" with all applicable global and local regulations.

Deputy Commissioner of Transport C Mallikarjun led the operation over the weekend.

The Transport Department has been working towards tax compliance among luxury vehicle owners in Bengaluru.

Reports from services who facilitate cryptocurrency transactions are driving the increase.

Last year, a record 54,000 suspicious transaction reports were made by the financial sector and others, such as virtual money services, fund managers, gambling companies, auctioneers and car dealers.

The reports are made to the Revenue Commissioners, who check for tax evasion, money laundering and other crimes and are also sent to the Garda for examination and investigation.

The volume of reports has more than doubled in the last five years as virtual asset service providers (Vasps) have become more popular.

These provide electronic services for payments and transfers, as well as asset storage, for consumers and businesses dealing in conventional currencies and cryptocurrencies. They must apply to the Central Bank of Ireland for registration in the Republic.

Reporting of suspect transactions by Vasps is driving the overall surge in all types of transactions being reported to Revenue.

In 2019 there were 24,500 suspect transactions reported by the financial sector to Revenue. That increased to 52,200 in 2023 and to 54,000 last year. As recently as four years ago, banks and the credit unions accounted for almost all the suspect transactions reported in the State, but the situation has changed rapidly.

In 2019 and 2020, no reports of suspicious transactions were made by Vasps and 300 were made in 2021. Reports by Vasps of suspected transactions have increased exponentially since then – to 6,600 in 2022 and 23,800 in 2023.

In that year, 2023, Vasps became the single biggest reporter of suspect financial transactions in the Republic, ahead of all banks and credit unions combined. A breakdown of how many suspicious transactions were reported by Vasps last year was not available.

However, Revenue confirmed the overall number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from all sources made last year was 54,000, a record high.

In reply to queries, Revenue said suspicious transaction reports formed “an integral part of the overall risk profile for individual taxpayers”. When suspicious transaction reports were received, they were “examined, matched to taxpayers’ information, and used to identify and subsequently confront noncompliance”.

“Where we identify risks, we undertake the appropriate compliance intervention, matching the nature of the intervention to the nature and scale of the noncompliance or tax evasion involved. We also work closely with the financial intelligence unit of An Garda Síochána and other State agencies concerned with STRs,” Revenue said.

The Banking & Payments Federation Ireland said: “Financial institutions, as well as other regulated entities, have a legal obligation to report any transaction where they have reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing and BPFI members work very closely with An Garda Síochána to meet these reporting requirements.”

The obligation to make the reports is provided for in the Criminal Justice Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act. In 2021, the legislation was amended to widen the range of institutions, including virtual asset service providers, legally obliged to report suspicious transactions, resulting in the huge volume of reports from Vasps.

The increase in suspicious transaction reports comes just weeks after it emerged tens of thousands of reports of suspected frauds, made to the Garda by the banks and other institutions, had not yet been examined. The volume of suspected frauds has grown so large over the last two years that gardaí have been unable to process and, subsequently, assign them for investigation.

Abby Lee Miller, the renowned American dance instructor and television personality, was sentenced to 54 months in prison in 2017 for bankruptcy fraud. This article will delve into the reasons behind her imprisonment and explore the complexities of her case.

Background and Early Life

Abby Lee Miller was born on September 11, 1959, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She grew up in a troubled home with an abusive father and a mother who struggled with addiction. Miller’s early life was marked by instability and neglect, which would later influence her approach to teaching and mentoring.

Career and Rise to Fame

Miller’s dance career began in the 1980s, and she quickly gained recognition for her expertise in ballet and jazz. She became a popular instructor and choreographer, teaching at various dance studios and schools. Her success led to a television career, with appearances on shows such as ""Dance Fever"" and ""Dance Moms.""

The ""Dance Moms"" Show

Miller’s most notable television show, ""Dance Moms,"" premiered in 2011 and followed the lives of a group of young dancers competing in the National Dance Crew Championship. The show was a huge success, and Miller became a household name. However, behind the scenes, Miller was known for her strict and demanding teaching style, which often led to conflicts with her dancers.

Bankruptcy and Financial Issues

In 2011, Miller filed for bankruptcy, citing over $2.5 million in debts. The bankruptcy filing was a result of her lavish spending on her dance studio, as well as her lavish lifestyle. Miller’s spending habits were criticized by her dancers and colleagues, who felt that she was prioritizing her own interests over their well-being.

The Investigation and Charges

In 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launched an investigation into Miller’s financial dealings. The investigation revealed that Miller had failed to pay taxes on her income, and that she had used her dance studio as a front for her personal spending. The IRS charged Miller with tax evasion, bankruptcy fraud, and other crimes.

The Trial and Sentencing

Miller’s trial began in 2014, and she was found guilty of tax evasion, bankruptcy fraud, and other crimes. In 2017, Miller was sentenced to 54 months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release. She was also ordered to pay over $1 million in restitution to her creditors.

The Impact of Her Imprisonment

Miller’s imprisonment had a significant impact on her life and career. Her release from prison in 2019 was met with widespread media attention, and she was forced to confront the consequences of her actions. Miller has since spoken publicly about the challenges she faced while in prison, including the difficulties of adjusting to life outside of a maximum-security facility.

The Lessons Learned

Miller’s imprisonment serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of financial recklessness and the importance of accountability. Her case highlights the need for individuals to prioritize their financial well-being and to take responsibility for their actions.

Conclusion

Abby Lee Miller’s imprisonment serves as a reminder of the consequences of financial mismanagement and the importance of accountability. Her case highlights the need for individuals to prioritize their financial well-being and to take responsibility for their actions.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California says Adam Iza, the founder of the crypto trading platform Zort, also known as “The Godfather,” is expected to enter a guilty plea for crimes related to extorting money from victims in Los Angeles.

Iza, who has been in federal custody since September 2024, is charged with conspiracy against rights, wire fraud and tax evasion.

Also agreeing to plead guilty is Iza’s alleged accomplice Eric Saavedra, an LASD deputy and a former federal task force officer. Saavedra intends to plead guilty to charges of conspiracy against rights and subscribing to a false tax return.

The two are expected to officially enter guilty pleas in an LA courthouse “in the coming days.”

Iza faces up to 35 years in federal prison, while Saavedra faces up to 13 years.

Says Tyler Hatcher, special agent in charge for the IRS Criminal Investigation’s Los Angeles Field Office.

“Mr. Iza’s and Mr. Saavedra’s relationship was little more than a thuggish partnership between a thief and a crooked cop. The public should be able to trust members of law enforcement, but Mr. Saavedra violated his oath for a payday. Mr. Iza stole from anyone he could and found a big payday by ripping off Meta so that he could afford to pay for Mr. Saavedra’s corrupt protection and assistance.”

According to the press release, Iza avoided $6.78 million in federal taxes in 2021 and Saavedra received about $373,146 in unreported income in the same year.

In one instance, Iza and Saavedra targeted a person Iza thought had a laptop computer with more than $100 million in cryptocurrency on it, according to federal prosecutors.

“After securing the illegal warrant, Saavedra tracked down the victim and provided the victim’s address to Iza. In March 2022, Iza caused three armed individuals to try to force entry into the victim’s home to steal the laptop. The individuals fled after the victim fired a gunshot in their direction.”

In other instances, “two LASD deputies held a victim at gunpoint inside Iza’s residence, after which Iza caused $25,000 to be transferred from the victim’s bank account to his own, and an October 2021 event in which Iza himself held a victim at gunpoint, causing that victim to transfer $127,000 to Iza.”

Iza also admitted “to stealing more than $37 million by fraudulently gaining access to Meta Platforms Inc. business manager accounts and their associated lines of credit from 2020 to 2022.”

I have observed a massive surge in the wealthy seeking golden visas or second passports, driven by political and economic instability, regional volatility and declining security and peace worldwide.

Since 2012, these programs have raised around $25 billion across Europe. This was particularly accelerated during the pandemic and the subsequent war in Ukraine, with programs like golden visas becoming a part of the contingency plan for many affluent individuals.

Investors are also drawn to the economic benefits, for golden visa programs typically involve real estate investments or other business opportunities that can yield profitable returns. Additionally, residency in a stable, well-developed country can provide access to high-quality healthcare, education and a favorable tax environment. For many, the golden visa is a pathway to a more secure and diversified lifestyle.

The Surge In Golden Visa Applications

While the golden visa program may appeal to affluent individuals from less developed nations, investors from the U.S. and the U.K. make a large percentage of beneficiaries of such programs, which offer their own versions of golden visas, have seen a surge in the number of investors seeking a golden visa with a particular interest in the EU and Caribbean. According to a survey, almost 60% of the U.S. investors cited it being a ""Plan B,"" while some seek lower cost of living and cheaper education.

Various governments initiated schemes to take advantage of golden visas and boost their countries' economies. The formula for those seeking the visa was simple: Invest in the economy, usually in real estate, for a certain number of years and get a new nationality.

Social media has been observed to have a great role in raising awareness and even influence people to opt for golden visas. In fact, my organization has been involved in social media marketing and has had success in acquiring clients through this means.

According to an article in Firstpost, a YouTube video, ""Countries for Americans Who Want to Leave the US,"" has amassed over 500,000 views and 4,000 comments in two weeks, while a Reddit thread on ""Emigrating After the US Election Results"" got over 1,000 comments in the same timeframe.

But this massive surge has also caused various problems for countries. Portugal saw a massive spike in prices and rents in the residential sector, where investors bought and rented out their residential properties; this sparked outrage among the locals and led to massive protests. The government changed the policy drastically, ""officially discontinuing the real estate option."" However, while real estate investments are often viewed as the most investor-friendly option, there are still other ways.

Understanding The Business Landscape In Your Target Location

Finding the right business idea for a particular city or neighborhood requires careful research. There are many options to consider, from everyday services like laundromats and gas stations to more specialized businesses like IT companies. Another good approach is to buy an existing business that is already successful and generating income.

Investors seeking golden visas can develop housing or apartment buildings, potentially purchasing land and using turnkey construction. While EU and U.S. residency options are narrowing (with the U.K., Ireland, Montenegro and Spain partially or fully ending their programs), opportunities remain. For those seeking residency without running a business, options like bank deposits or government bonds exist, typically requiring a $200,000 minimum investment. Stock market investments also offer a potentially lucrative alternative over a five-year period.

Tightening Regulatory Environments

The EU is continuously pressuring its members to make the golden visa regulations more stringent. For example, as of this writing, Spain is set to ban golden visas through property investment. However, Caribbean countries and countries like the U.S, UAE and Hungary still offer attractive ways to invest and build a life abroad.

For investors seeking golden visas primarily for a second passport without needing to relocate, political stability may be less significant. Countries with strong passport rankings and some political instability can still be viable, especially when financial requirements are lowered to attract participants.

Grandfather clauses, as seen in Spain and Portugal, protect existing golden visa holders under the original terms even if regulations change. This ensures that initial investments or submitted applications remain valid. In tightening regulatory environments, acting swiftly can help investors secure benefits before further restrictions are imposed.",positive,positive,0.5793522596359253,positive,0.9998561143875122,positive,0.999601662158966,"['positve', 'neutral', 'negative']","[0.5484349429607391, 0.013484349503414705, 0.49028522477601655]",positive,0.5484349429607391

Annual revenue run rate for Microsoft's AI business is up 175% YoY

Microsoft opened two new data center regions last quarter

Microsoft revenue climbed a very healthy 12% year-over-year in the final three months of 2024, bringing the total quarterly figure to $69.6 billion and surpassing previous analyst expectations.

In an official announcement, CEO Satya Nadella noted Microsoft's AI business’s annual revenue run rate now stands at $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.

“We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead,” said Nadella.

Microsoft revenue propped up by AI

CFO Amy Hood confirmed Microsoft Cloud revenue for the most recent quarter rose 21% year-over-year to $40.9 billion. Key to its success has been the growing demand for AI tools and data centers.

The company was keen to highlight Copilot in Excel with Python, the launch of Microsoft Places, LinkedIn upgrades, and two new data center region launches – New Zealand North and Taiwan North, as particularly key recent AI launches.

Speaking on the earnings call, Nadella added: “We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years.”

Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue grew by 8%, with its Commercial counterpart seeing a 16% growth, with businesses looking to invest in connected services powered by artificial intelligence.

The substantial double-digit growth is largely responsible for Microsoft’s recent financial success, but other areas of the business also saw minor upticks. Its Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased by 4% while Xbox content and services revenue increased by 2%, indicative of slow but steady consumer interest.

However, while the deprecation of Windows 10 is set to see consumer spending rise when it comes to hardware and software updates, some personal customers have been left with a bitter taste in their mouths after Microsoft 365 subscriptions became more expensive this month. Some Australian customers are seeing price hikes of up to 46%.

Most of the stocks rose in Q4, benefiting from the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, while other regional markets came under pressure amid worries over trade tariffs, according to GlobalData, publishers of RBI.

Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles Analyst at GlobalData, said: “The Federal Reserve implemented consecutive interest rate cuts of 25 basis points in November 2024 and December 2024. However, in December 2024, the Fed sparked a stock market sell-off by reducing the projected number of interest rate cuts for 2025. This adjustment was driven by concerns over persistently stubborn inflation.

“China unveiled a series of stimulus measures during the last quarter, extending its support beyond the traditional interest rate cuts. The country’s central bank emphasised its commitment to support economic growth by lowering the reserve requirement ratio, revising mortgage terms, and providing liquidity support for stock buybacks. However, not all these measures have been fully implemented, and their impact remains limited to date.”

US banks lead the way

JPMorgan Chase continues to remain as the world’s largest bank by market cap, recording an increase of 37.2% to $674.9bn by the end of Q4 2024. This growth was primarily fueled by higher asset management fees in its Asset & Wealth Management and Consumer & Community Banking divisions, as well as a notable rise in investment banking fees, which enabled it to outpace its competitors.

Goldman Sachs posted a stellar 42.9% growth, which propelled it to ninth place in the chart from 13th position in the previous quarter. The growth reflects its success in capital markets and advisory businesses.

However, TD Bank’s market cap declined by 20.1% to $93.1bn, following a disappointing fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates. The bank also suspended several of its mid-term financial growth targets after failing to meet them for fiscal 2024. Additionally, TD Bank agreed to pay a fine exceeding $3bn after pleading guilty to violations of US anti-money laundering regulations.

Chinese big four banks see 30%-40% rise

The market value of China’s top four banks – ICBC, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Construction Bank – experienced growth in the range of 30%-40% over the year. It was largely driven by the stimulus package announced in September 2024. This package comprised a series of monetary measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These actions were designed to inject approximately $113bn-114bn into the economy, with the goal of enhancing liquidity, revitalising the housing market, and stabilising financial markets.

European banks presented a mixed bag of results. HSBC Holdings saw a modest increase in market cap by 13.5% to reach $176.9bn, as it focused on its Asia-centric strategy. UBS Group faced stagnation with its market cap dipping slightly (-0.4%) due to the integration challenges following its acquisition of Credit Suisse.

Indian banks demonstrated resilience, with ICICI Bank emerging as a standout performer, with its market cap growing by 25.8% to $105.7bn, highlighting the strength of India’s expanding digital banking and credit ecosystem. However, HDFC Bank’s market cap growth remained subdued, recording just a 1.6% increase to $158.5bn, due to rising competition and cost pressures.

Grandhi concluded: “GlobalData predicts that tariffs expected to be imposed under Trump’s administration and planned tax cuts in 2025 may offset each other. However, risks such as rising sovereign debt, a stronger dollar, foreign outflows from emerging markets, geopolitical tensions in West Asia, China’s economic stimulus, and the yen carry trade are key factors likely to influence market performance and economic growth.”",positive,positive,0.9502131342887878,positive,1.0,positive,0.99972265958786,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.5785059928894043, 0.011789881624281406, 0.010469906032085419]",positive,0.5785059928894043

The company's Experiences segment - which includes the theme parks and Disney Cruise Line - saw a 3% increase in revenue, to $9.415 billion. Operating income ticked up slightly, by $0.5 million, to $3.110 billion.

The international parks carried the segment during the quarter, with higher attendance and per capita guest spending pushing their operating income up 28%. Attendance was down at Walt Disney World, however, due to the two hurricanes, including one that closed the resort for a day and saw the cancellation of a Disney Cruise Line sailing. Disney also reported higher costs in the segment due to the Disney Cruise Line's expansion, which saw the Disney Treasure launch in December.

""Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income declined 5%, reflecting a 9 percentage-point adverse impact to year-over-year growth due to the hurricanes and cruise pre-opening expenses,"" Disney said in its earnings report.

Nevertheless, Disney said that it anticipates 6% to 8% operating income growth for the Experiences segment in its 2025 fiscal year, which runs through the end of September. During that time, Disneyland will kick off its 70th anniversary celebration in May, and Hong Kong Disneyland will open its 20th anniversary party this summer. And, oh yeah, Universal is opening a new theme park in Orlando, too.

""Our Ql results for our Experiences segment demonstrated Disney's strong and enduring appeal in family travel,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said. ""We continue work on a robust slate of new projects as we bring our most popular IP to life in innovative ways and execute against a carefully designed and planned investment strategy.

Financial Highlights

Microsoft’s Q2 2025 earnings were nothing short of stellar. The company reported revenue of $69.6 billion, marking a 12% increase year-over-year. This growth was underpinned by significant gains in its cloud business, particularly Azure, and its burgeoning AI sector. Earnings per share stood at $3.23, surpassing analyst expectations and indicating a healthy profit margin despite the massive investments in AI infrastructure.

Microsoft Cloud: With a total revenue of $40.9 billion, up 21%, Microsoft’s cloud services are the backbone of its financial success. Azure alone saw a 31% growth, with AI services contributing 13 percentage points to this figure. This is a testament to the company’s strategic focus on cloud computing and AI integration.

AI Revenue: The AI business has been highlighted as one of Microsoft’s fastest-growing areas, with an annual revenue run rate now exceeding $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year. This figure underscores Microsoft’s position as a leader in the AI revolution, integrating AI into products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure AI services.

Market Reaction

Despite the positive earnings report, Microsoft’s shares experienced a downturn in after-hours trading, dropping 4.5%. This unexpected market reaction was primarily due to concerns over the company’s AI spending and the competitive landscape, particularly with the entry of cost-effective AI models from China, like DeepSeek.

@alex on X noted, “$MSFT: ‘Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.’ ‘This quarter Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year’ – 31% growth at ‘Azure and other cloud services revenue'”.

@ZorTrades observed, “Microsoft: AI Strength, Cloud Disappointment Microsoft’s stock took a hit in after-hours trading, despite reporting strong earnings per share and revenue beats. The problem? The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, missed estimates despite growing 19% YoY.”.

Strategic Implications

Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud computing isn’t just about financial gains; it’s about positioning the company at the forefront of technological innovation:

AI Integration: The integration of AI across Microsoft’s product lineup, from Microsoft 365 to Azure, shows a strategic bet on AI being the next frontier for computing. This move is not just about enhancing current offerings but about creating new paradigms in how businesses and consumers interact with technology.

Cloud Dominance: Azure’s continued growth, even amidst global economic uncertainties, demonstrates Microsoft’s stronghold in the cloud market. The company’s investments in expanding its cloud infrastructure are paying dividends, offering scalability and flexibility that enterprises demand.

Competitive Landscape: The rise of competitors like DeepSeek, offering AI solutions at lower costs, introduces a new dynamic in the market. Microsoft’s response, including the integration of DeepSeek into its Azure offerings, suggests an adaptive strategy to maintain its market dominance while embracing broader AI accessibility.

Cloud and AI Investments Paying Off

Microsoft’s Q2 2025 earnings paint a picture of a company in robust health, powered by strategic investments in cloud and AI. However, the market’s reaction to these results indicates that investors are keenly watching how Microsoft navigates the increasingly competitive AI landscape and manages its substantial capital expenditures.

@danielnewmanUV commented on X, “Here we go Microsoft: Always my favorite visual from @EconomyApp The rapid leg down was all about cloud missing the number and sequential Azure growth being down. The recovery is all about the AI Revenue number being up 175% to $13 Billion and knowing this is VERY EARLY in.”

Its technology is present in the chips of the vast majority of mobile devices and low-power electronics worldwide. However, it seems that its financial growth has not kept pace. Now, Arm reportedly wants to change that with an increase in the prices of its chip technology and the development of its own hardware.

Arm reportedly to increase prices for its chip technology by up to 300%

If you are not aware, Arm provides the Cortex CPU core designs present in virtually all smartphone and tablet chips. It also develops the Mali and Immortalis GPUs that are usually combined with its CPU cores. Major chip developers, such as Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek, turn to Arm to license their designs. Under the contract, Arm takes a small royalty for each chip unit produced with its technology.

Now, Reuters reports that Arm is considering up to a 300% increase in prices for its developments. More specifically, this could apply to ready-made parts of chip designs. In other words, technologies like stock Cortex-A7xx cores and Immortalis GPUs could soon become much more expensive.

If implemented, the change could not affect big names in the chip development industry like Qualcomm and Apple. These companies can develop their own custom CPU cores based on Arm technologies. Apple has been doing this for a long time, while Qualcomm recently re-implemented custom cores—Oryon—in phone and laptop chips. Samsung also designs its own CPU cores for Exynos chips. Not so for MediaTek, though, since even its most expensive SoCs use stock Cortex CPU cores.

Designing its own chipsets is also on the table

In addition to the potential price increase in its licenses, Arm is also reportedly planning to develop its own chipsets. That is, the company could not limit itself to designing the CPU architecture to sell to external SoC manufacturers but could become direct competition for some of its main clients in the industry.

Arm is not happy with the pace of its business growth. Ironically, brands that use its technology as the basis of their products achieve much higher revenues. In 2024, Arm achieved revenues of 3.23 billion dollars, while Apple’s for the same year were up to 90 times greater.

The report refers to the company’s new business model as the “Picasso” Project. The idea isn’t exactly new, having been in development since 2019. After all, such a major change couldn’t be designed and implemented overnight. Part of the plan was revealed during the trial against Qualcomm, where Arm—unsuccessfully—sought to negotiate a new licensing deal.

Arm reportedly wants the “Picasso” Project to bring in around $1 billion a year from the smartphone industry over the next ten years. Only time will tell if the firm is able to achieve its goal.",positive,positive,0.6260936260223389,neutral,0.9929774403572084,positive,0.9969651103019714,"['negative', 'positve', 'neutral']","[0.8701601624488831, 0.21523644030094147, 0.013780025765299797]",negative,0.8701601624488831
http://skift.com/2025/02/02/feeding-frenzy-the-year-of-ma-in-travel-tech/,2025-02-02T14:00:00Z,"TravelPerk kicked off the year with some big news: The late-stage corporate travel tech startup raised $200 million and acquired another company.

Both developments were wrapped into a single announcement that exemplifies a major trend in travel tech right now: A surge in acquisitions by private-equity backed software companies.

Private equity firms have accumulated an estimated $3 trillion that they need to deploy, and roughly $300 billion of that is earmarked for tech, according to investment banks we spoke to. These private equity firms have been leading large fundraises for late-stage startups that are working to modernize behind-the-scenes software that powers the travel industry. And those startups are deploying that newly raised capital to grow their businesses organically and via acquisitions.

Investment bank AGC Partners says these PE-backed players are going on a “feeding frenzy” to acquire smaller companies and consolidate their respective markets. AGC Partners estimates that there were roughly 180 M&A deals in travel tech last year, accounting for roughly one-third of all tech deals. That number has been steadily increasing since the low of roughly 77 deals in 2021.

“This is by far the biggest year that the space has ever seen from a transaction perspective in terms of count,” said Jonathan Weibrecht, partner at investment bank AGC Partners.

We’ve spoken to nearly a dozen founders and CEOs of companies that secured large fundraises over the last year, and nearly all of them have said M&A is on the radar. Investment bankers and private equity investors say they’re expecting an even busier year in 2025.

Driving the action: Tech systems need upgrades to handle unprecedented growth in travel, and private equity firms are deploying billions to take part. In 2025, expect more consolidation as well-funded late-stage startups buy up smaller players, reshaping the industry’s behind-the-scenes infrastructure ecosystem.

“We expect to see more activity in 2025 than 2024 in terms of number of deals,” said Min Liu, managing director of the travel practice for investment bank Cambon Partners.

Private Equity Dives into Travel

Nearly every major late-stage startup platform has just raised capital or is in the process, Weibrecht said.

Flyr, for example, raised $225 million toward its effort to replace the decades-old airline retail infrastructure with something akin to online shopping. Lighthouse raised $370 million for a platform that helps hotels make decisions about pricing, promotion, and distribution. And Hostaway raised $365 million for short-term rental management tech.

Following that trend, there likely are more large capital raises coming in 2025.

“Private equity hasn't really paid a lot of attention to travel much at all for a long time. I think it’s a sign of maturity within a market when you see private equity coming in,” said Laurence Tosi, managing partner and founder of WestCap. Tosi was Airbnb’s CFO for nearly three years starting in 2015 and helped Brian Chesky secure billions of dollars in funding.

WestCap led the last two funding rounds for Flyr, which has made multiple acquisitions in the past couple of years.

Background Players Take the Stage

Consumer brands like Expedia Group and Booking Holdings dominated M&A cycles last decade, consolidating the consumer market to create the giants that exist today.

Much of the activity in that space has settled, with exceptions, and the focus now is on consolidating the business-to-business tech.

About 80% of the 180 travel tech deals last year were involving business-to-business software, according to data from AGC Partners.

“Whenever you get funding, inevitably follows a period of consolidation, or movement amongst the different players,” Tosi said.

For example, Mews, a hotel tech startup, recently bought its fifth company in the past year – that makes 12 acquisitions since 2019.

Backed by private equity company Kinnivek and Goldman Sachs, with credit from Vista Equity Partners, Mews is focused on M&A as a strategy for growth, said founder Richard Valtr.

Mews is in the business of trying to modernize an antiquated piece of hotel tech, the property management system. Whether it’s Mews or Flyr or Travelperk, building these platforms and growing the client base is capital intensive — even more so now as the rise of AI forces founders to reimagine their products.

Despite so much money being available for large fundraises, early stage funding is still tight for young startups because investors are looking for companies with proven business models.

That means startups and small businesses will have a hard time investing at the level needed to upgrade tech and scale.

“That requires a lot of investment. And In order to make that investment, you need to have scale. And if you don't have scale, you can't make that investment, and you fall further behind,” said Akhil Chainwala, senior investment director for private equity firm Kinnevik. The firm led the last round for Mews and participated in the past few rounds for TravelPerk.

Valtr of Mews says that’s why it often makes sense for those smaller companies to join well-funded companies rather than continue independently.

“I think for a lot of providers, it's basically a double whammy. First, they thought they could still kind of ride out the cloud wave. And now, thinking about how they're going to ride out the AI wave is making a lot of them feel nervous. So I feel like that's one of the things that is driving interest (in selling),” Valtr said.

“If you haven't really invested into that core R&D piece of your system for a long time, it's difficult to actually start that up.”

Nearly 40% of the travel tech M&A deals last were involving hotel tech, AGC Partners found. But the firm expects more activity in the airline tech space as new platforms push to scale.

“It's a very attractive software market because retention is so incredibly high,” Weibrecht said.

Motivation to Grow

The investment bankers say that these PE-backed companies are going on acquisition sprees because they need to grow revenue.

AGC expects this type of strategy to continue over the next two years.

“The use of funds for all of these capital raises is to go do follow-on M&A,” Weibrecht said.

“You've got all these companies between $50 million and several hundred million of net [annual recurring revenue], too small to be public … probably too small for the premium-paying horizontal acquirers to snap them up. And so what they need to do is they need to go and buy revenue.”

Mews is one that will eventually get to the exit point, and that’s something its leaders have to think about. It’s still a relatively small company now in terms of market share, with several notable competitors (including market share leader Oracle Hospitality.)

“I think at our scale and our size, it's difficult to understand who would be the potential acquirers,” Valtr said. “I think that I wouldn't be performing my fiduciary duty if I didn't say that we'd always look at what would be the best outcome for our shareholders and, ultimately, for our customers. So I think if we could also go towards an IPO, I think that would also be a great mark.”

Who’s Selling

The selling price for most of the deals in 2024 was undisclosed. That often — but not always — means the deals were small.

It’s more of a consolidation of fragments, with buyers looking to add clients or geographic coverage, improve tech, or add a group of new employees. The sellers are often companies generating between $5 million and $50 million in annual recurring revenue, AGC said.

“A lot of what we like to do with our companies is what we call strategic bolt-on acquisitions. So they're not necessarily transformational, but they're adding a product set they didn't already have,” Tosi said.

The sellers are often smaller startups that made deals before the pandemic and are now having a harder time securing venture capital. If they’re struggling to get to the next stage, now is a good time to exit.

Baby Boomer founders are another group of sellers, looking for an exit as they prepare to retire. They often have small, independent businesses — like corporate travel agencies or old hotel tech — with loyal customers.

Juniper Group is open to hearing from them. The company plans to buy as many as a dozen travel tech companies this year, according to Jaime Sastre, CEO of Juniper Group.

“Next year, we'll do more, and the next one, we'll do more,” Sastre said.

While the company isn’t backed by private equity, it has jumped full force into the travel M&A market. Sastre formed Juniper Group in 2020, and it now has 31 companies, including around a dozen in travel.

Juniper Group is an operating portfolio of Vela Software, one of the six divisions of Toronto-based Constellation Software, which owns more than 1,000 companies. It has an unusual model: It buys small travel tech companies, grows their revenue, and then uses that revenue to grow organically and buy more. Unlike private equity, which typically sells portfolio companies after about five years, Juniper Group plans to “never” sell any of its companies.

Juniper Group would be buying regardless, Sastre said, but he thinks the market has eased a bit since the pandemic. The companies that survived are growing again.

“It's a good moment probably to sell because they suffered Covid, they're revamping now with that growth and better profitability, and it's probably a good moment for them to to get out and for others to get in,” Sastre said.

He said Juniper Group often appeals to owner-operators ready to step away from such heavy responsibility while also continuing to run the company. Because Juniper never sells, the stakes are a bit different.

“We don't care about how much our companies are worth. All we care about is how much return are we getting from those companies, and what's the future in terms of financial growth of this company.”

Moving Money

While middle market companies are leading the charge, there’s plenty of activity elsewhere.

Travel corporations, finally seeing substantial recovery post-pandemic, are deploying their own capital into growth initiatives. Amadeus, for example, made two big purchases.

Despegar plans to sell to tech investment firm Prosus for $1.7 billion.

And there will always be companies changing hands in big private equity acquisition deals. Cvent, for example, was fully acquired in 2023 for $4.6 billion. “At some point in time, you need to change the profile of your investors who can continue your company’s journey for the next stage of growth,” Liu said.

And for a similar reason as the buildup of private equity, Liu suspects there could be IPOs in the near future from travel companies who have been talking about it but haven't pulled the trigger.

The parent company of Hotelbeds, for example, just said it’s planning an IPO at a valuation of $5.1 billion.

“Very strong landmark deal this year — the first one to watch,” Liu said.

“This is a case where investors held because of Covid. You will see that the financial performance has been very, very good post-Covid. Now is a good time to go to market again, and the IPO market is opening.”

Regulatory Hurdles

For any large deals, there’s the issue of regulations to watch out for. And that may be a deterrent, Liu said.

Industry leaders suspect there may be relaxed regulation around M&A in the U.S. under the new presidential administration. But large deals often are subject to EU approval, as well, and that can cause deals to fall apart.

Booking Holdings was blocked from buying eTraveli Group for that reason. And it’s unclear whether Amex GBT will be allowed to purchase CWT. It’s not in the travel space, but the Trump administration has already sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise from acquiring Juniper Networks (unrelated to Juniper Group).

That means traditional acquirers, like Google and Booking Holdings, need to take precautions before attempting deals.

“Booking — really, any type of deal is difficult because of this regulatory scrutiny,” Liu said.

“​​I don't see very, very large deals happening in this space in the coming years. For large deals, for mergers of equals, there will be increased scrutiny from regulators.”

But smaller companies, the ones dominating the cycle now, likely won’t need to worry about that.

“It's very active in the small, mid-sized deals because there's a lot of market interest and investor interest to build platforms. So they are the main driving force of the activity on the market currently,” Liu said.

Navigating the Risk

While there is a lot of consolidation happening, acquisitions come with a level of risk and consequence that some don’t believe is worth it.

Adam Harris, CEO of hotel tech company and Mews competitor Cloudbeds, told Skift last year that M&A hasn’t been a growth strategy for his company — though that could change in the future.

He believes the process can create a bad experience for clients. And, the cost of integrating them takes away from resources that the company would use to improve the product.

""We’ve seen other companies roll up players similar to them, but we haven’t necessarily seen that followed by a tremendous amount of organic customer growth. This makes us wonder how well that horizontal strategy is working for hoteliers,"" Harris said.

Although Flyr has made multiple acquisitions over the past two years, Flyr CEO Alex Mans said it’s not an easy process to undergo because it often means integrating different company culture, products, and geographies.

“It's always much harder than you think it’s going to be,” Mans told Skift last year. “I'm still very fortunate that we were able to aquire great companies with great people that are really helping us grow and accelerate the business. But that, too, is also harder and more difficult than you think it is when you do it.”

Building a company via acquisition also doesn’t guarantee it’ll turn out successfully. Look at travel agency tech company Mondee, which just filed bankruptcy after acquiring five companies in 2023.

Still, Valtr of Mews believes it’s a good way to more quickly move the industry forward.

“I think that people tend to see M&A as this terrible thing. It doesn't need to be this negative perspective: These are private equity companies that are going to come in and just try and milk the customers as much as possible,” Valtr said. “You can still be a fast-scaling, product-first company, and still also be wanting to liberate the rest of the market from these legacy solutions.”

https://cryptoslate.com/oh-raises-4-5-million-to-empower-creators-through-ai-and-web3-fusion/,2025-01-11T03:00:58Z,"Oh, an innovative platform blending AI with Web3 technology has secured $4.5 million in seed funding, according to a Jan. 10 statement shared with CryptoSlate.

The oversubscribed round saw contributions from major players like Tangent, Big Brain Holdings, Kosmos Ventures, Tagus Capital, and Bodhi Ventures. It also received support from prominent angel investors like Delphi Ventures’ Yan Liberman.

What is Oh?

Oh aims to revolutionize how creators produce, interact, and profit in the Web3 era by integrating decentralization, user empowerment, and advanced AI technology.

Nic Young, co-founder and CEO of Oh, stated that the platform seeks to transform the creator economy by merging AI’s personalization strengths with the decentralized and censorship-resistant features of Web3. He emphasized that this combination offers a disruptive model for creators and their audiences.

He said:

“The intersection of AI and Web3 represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to disrupt the creator economy. By combining AI’s ability to generate and personalize content with the power to create communities with agentic capabilities, built on the decentralization and censorship resistance of Web3, traditional systems simply can’t compete.”

Ohchats and superModels

At the core of Oh’s ecosystem is OhChat, an AI-powered platform boasting a user base of nearly 100,000 across 174 countries. The platform allows users to interact with AI-generated characters, from unique digital personalities to virtual replicas of real-world figures.

Notably, celebrities like Carmen Electra and Kaili Thorne are already using the platform to engage millions of followers through AI-enhanced digital twins. Building on this success, Oh plans to launch “superModels” — autonomous, next-generation AI digital creators.

These AI agents go beyond simple interactions, offering dynamic capabilities such as building a social media presence, remembering user interactions, and developing evolving personalities.

SuperModel owners can monetize these digital agents, launch tokens linked to their revenue, and benefit from permissionless buybacks. This approach allows creators and their communities to share in the financial growth presented by the projects.

Token launch

Oh’s roadmap includes introducing token capabilities in the first quarter of this year to support its ecosystem.",positive,neutral,0.7162477374076843,positive,0.9889310002326964,positive,0.9994446635246276,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.8560901880264282, 0.02190837636590004, 0.01127636805176735]",positive,0.8560901880264282

Shares in the S&PASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) insurance company closed out 2023 trading for $5.66. When the closing bell sounded on 31 December 2024, those same shares were changing hands for $8.46.

That put the IAG stock up a remarkable 49.5% over the year. For some context, the ASX 200 gained 7.5% in 2024.

And this is a company with a market cap north of $20 billion we're talking about, not some speculative ASX microcap stock. And we haven't even included the 27 cents a share in partly franked dividends IAG paid out over the year.

If we add those back in, the cumulative value of shares in the ASX 200 insurance stock leapt 54.2% in 2024.

Here's what went right for the IAG share price in the year just past.

How did the IAG share price rocket 50% in 2024?

As you can see on the chart up top, the IAG share price was in a pronounced uptrend throughout 2024 amid strong financial growth metrics posted over the year.

IAG reported its full FY 2024 results on 21 August.

Highlights included a 7.9% year-on-year increase in net profit after tax (NPAT) to $898 million. While IAG's reported insurance margin lifted by 6.0% from FY 2023 to 15.6%.

The insurance company's gross written premium (GWP) also grew strongly, coming in at $16.4 billion for the year, up 11%.

Likely stoking ASX 200 investor interest, IAG said it was aiming for FY 2025 GWP growth in the ""mid-to-high single digits"".

ASX 200 insurer roars to multi-year highs

The IAG share price received another big boost on 28 November,

That's when the company announced that it had entered into a 25-year exclusive strategic alliance to provide general insurance products and services for RACQ members and Queenslanders.

Under the agreement, IAG will acquire 90% of RACQ's existing insurance underwriting business for a consideration of $855 million. IAG has the option to acquire the remaining 10% in two years.

""IAG has a well-established presence in Queensland through our trusted insurance brands, and we are excited to now help protect and serve RACQ's members,"" IAG CEO Nick Hawkins said on the day.

Hawkins added:

RACQ will maintain brand and customer relationships, while leveraging IAG's scale and financial strength, best-in-class technology for claims, policies and pricing, customer orientated claims experience and underwriting expertise.

I have observed a massive surge in the wealthy seeking golden visas or second passports, driven by political and economic instability, regional volatility and declining security and peace worldwide.

Since 2012, these programs have raised around $25 billion across Europe. This was particularly accelerated during the pandemic and the subsequent war in Ukraine, with programs like golden visas becoming a part of the contingency plan for many affluent individuals.

Investors are also drawn to the economic benefits, for golden visa programs typically involve real estate investments or other business opportunities that can yield profitable returns. Additionally, residency in a stable, well-developed country can provide access to high-quality healthcare, education and a favorable tax environment. For many, the golden visa is a pathway to a more secure and diversified lifestyle.

The Surge In Golden Visa Applications

While the golden visa program may appeal to affluent individuals from less developed nations, investors from the U.S. and the U.K. make a large percentage of beneficiaries of such programs, which offer their own versions of golden visas, have seen a surge in the number of investors seeking a golden visa with a particular interest in the EU and Caribbean. According to a survey, almost 60% of the U.S. investors cited it being a ""Plan B,"" while some seek lower cost of living and cheaper education.

Various governments initiated schemes to take advantage of golden visas and boost their countries' economies. The formula for those seeking the visa was simple: Invest in the economy, usually in real estate, for a certain number of years and get a new nationality.

Social media has been observed to have a great role in raising awareness and even influence people to opt for golden visas. In fact, my organization has been involved in social media marketing and has had success in acquiring clients through this means.

According to an article in Firstpost, a YouTube video, ""Countries for Americans Who Want to Leave the US,"" has amassed over 500,000 views and 4,000 comments in two weeks, while a Reddit thread on ""Emigrating After the US Election Results"" got over 1,000 comments in the same timeframe.

But this massive surge has also caused various problems for countries. Portugal saw a massive spike in prices and rents in the residential sector, where investors bought and rented out their residential properties; this sparked outrage among the locals and led to massive protests. The government changed the policy drastically, ""officially discontinuing the real estate option."" However, while real estate investments are often viewed as the most investor-friendly option, there are still other ways.

Understanding The Business Landscape In Your Target Location

Finding the right business idea for a particular city or neighborhood requires careful research. There are many options to consider, from everyday services like laundromats and gas stations to more specialized businesses like IT companies. Another good approach is to buy an existing business that is already successful and generating income.

Investors seeking golden visas can develop housing or apartment buildings, potentially purchasing land and using turnkey construction. While EU and U.S. residency options are narrowing (with the U.K., Ireland, Montenegro and Spain partially or fully ending their programs), opportunities remain. For those seeking residency without running a business, options like bank deposits or government bonds exist, typically requiring a $200,000 minimum investment. Stock market investments also offer a potentially lucrative alternative over a five-year period.

Tightening Regulatory Environments

The EU is continuously pressuring its members to make the golden visa regulations more stringent. For example, as of this writing, Spain is set to ban golden visas through property investment. However, Caribbean countries and countries like the U.S, UAE and Hungary still offer attractive ways to invest and build a life abroad.

For investors seeking golden visas primarily for a second passport without needing to relocate, political stability may be less significant. Countries with strong passport rankings and some political instability can still be viable, especially when financial requirements are lowered to attract participants.

Grandfather clauses, as seen in Spain and Portugal, protect existing golden visa holders under the original terms even if regulations change. This ensures that initial investments or submitted applications remain valid. In tightening regulatory environments, acting swiftly can help investors secure benefits before further restrictions are imposed.",neutral,positive,0.5793522596359253,positive,0.9998561143875122,positive,0.999601662158966,"['positve', 'neutral', 'negative']","[0.5484349429607391, 0.013484349503414705, 0.49028522477601655]",positive,0.5484349429607391

Self-made millionaires think differently about money—they view it as a tool for creating opportunities rather than something to chase or fear. Their unique mindsets and habits allow them to take calculated risks, build multiple income streams, and focus on long-term wealth creation. They prioritize continuous learning, investing in personal and financial growth, and staying disciplined in their approach. These aren't talents they were born with—they are skills and beliefs cultivated over time.

The good news? You can learn and adopt these ways, too, transforming how you think about money to pave your own path to financial success.

Let’s explore how self-made millionaires think differently about money:

1. Money mindset

Millionaires focus on opportunities, not limitations. They are careful to think in abundance over scarcity and believe that their dreams and goals are achievable. Knowing that the wealth is there if they work for it fuels their mindset.

2. Earning over saving

While saving and avoiding excessive spending are critical parts to building wealth, millionaires also know that they must prioritize growing income streams. They understand that investments, side hustles, and passive income sources are ways to help build wealth and they capitalize on that.

3. View money as a tool

Self-made millionaires use money to create freedom and impact. They view money not as an end goal but to unlock opportunities, grow wealth, and contribute meaningfully. By reinvesting their earnings into ventures that yield returns (real estate, stocks, businesses), they create financial growth.

4. Take calculated risks

Wealth is built by taking informed, calculated risks; not by playing it safe. They understand that building a business, investing in real estate, and entering volatile markets requires a strategy to mitigate risks and increase success.

5. Value continuous learning

Millionaires invest their time in learning how financial literacy and personal development can advance their goals. They read books, attend seminars, and learn from others about ways to increase their wealth. They understand that there is a need for continuous learning.

6. Focus on the long game

Building wealth takes patience and discipline, and millionaires know how important it is to keep their eye on the end goal. They avoid get-rich-quick schemes and delay instant gratification by keeping to their strategy and plan for building wealth.

7. Redefine failure

Failure is part of life, but millionaires see failure as a steppingstone to success. They take a lesson from every failure and use it to improve their strategy. They don’t let failure deter them from their goals; they use failure to learn and grow.

The bottom line is that you don’t need to be born with these habits; they are skills that you can learn and implement today. If you want to become a self-made millionaire, you can start by reflecting on your current money mindset and adopting just one strategy from this list. As you master it, add another one.

That means you can only take on so many clients, work so many hours, and scale your income to a certain point before hitting the ceiling. That’s why it’s important to know how to create passive income streams in your business – it allows you to generate more revenue.

Passive income helps you make more money without trading your time for money. It’s not about doing nothing and expecting cash to roll in; it’s about setting up systems and investments that will bring in additional income with minimal ongoing effort.

When you think of successful entrepreneurs, you’ll notice that they rarely rely on just one source of income. Smart entrepreneurs have diversified income streams. This is important as it reduces financial risk, increases stability, and creates long-term wealth.

Building passive income into your business can give you more freedom, security, and financial growth.

Let’s explore some of the ways you can create passive income streams in your business:

Subscription models

A subscription model creates a stream of recurring revenue while providing ongoing value to your audience. by offering a paid community, exclusive content hub, or ongoing coaching, you can build deeper relationships with your customers while building a steady income. Subscribers pay a monthly or annual fee to stay connected and gain continuous value.

License your intellectual property

When you have a proven framework, methodology, or training program, you can license this asset and generate passive income. By allowing others to use your system in exchange for a licensing fee, you can scale your business without being involved in every sale. This works well for educators and service providers who have repeatable business that drives results.

Sell business assets through white labelling

This is a powerful way to monetize your expertise by allowing others to rebrand and sell your service package, software, or tool as their own. White labels offer a ready-made solution to businesses to purchase and offer as their own brand. This model allows you to generate passive income with minimal ongoing effort.

Launch an online course

When you create an online course, it allows you to package your expertise into a scalable, passive income stream. You can reach a wider audience without the limitations of one-on-one coaching or live training. Once the course is set up, sales and delivery can be automated, generating revenue while you focus on other areas of your business.

Sell digital products

Selling digital products that complement your product or service is one of the easiest and most scalable ways to generate passive income in your business. You can sell e-books, templates, guides, and printables that provide value to your community and require minimal upkeep in your business. Digital products provide high profit margins and automated sales.

The bottom line is that when you build passive income streams into your business it’s about working smarter, not harder. Having passive income streams allows you to diversify your revenue, increase financial stability in your business, and reduce your dependence on active income. These income streams require upfront effort, but once set up, they can generate consistent revenue with minimal ongoing work.",neutral,neutral,0.8135008215904236,positive,0.9963629841804504,positive,0.9995799660682678,"['positve', 'neutral', 'negative']","[0.9026632905006409, 0.0709044486284256, 0.025063758715987206]",positive,0.9026632905006409
https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2025/01/16/how-to-get-rich-through-smart-money-management/,2025-01-16T11:00:00Z,"Money management is often viewed as boring or unsexy, but while it might not be glamorous, it is the foundation for wealth. If you want to get rich, developing these skills is not just practical; it’s empowering and the first step toward creating the life you want.

The problem is many people overlook the essential skill of money management, and it’s costing them their financial future.

Consistent money management is the backbone of many wealth journeys, requiring you to ensure that resources are allocated wisely and reinvested for growth. Without a strong financial foundation it will be difficult to reach the goal of financial freedom.

What Money Management Really Means

Money management means taking control of your financial resources to achieve both short and long-term growth. It requires key practices such as budgeting, saving, investing, tracking cash flow, and understanding your overall financial picture. It’s smart to know where your money is coming from, all your sources of income, and where it is going. You need to make deliberate choices to align your financial behavior with your goals.

When you are intentional about managing your finances, you can identify problem areas such as overspending, cut unnecessary expenses, and redirect those funds towards saving and investing. For example, if you can find $400 a month in savings by cutting eating out for lunch, you can redirect that money into an investment account. Over time, that small shift can yield significant returns.

Money management shouldn’t be about depriving yourself, but more about making conscious choices on where you want your money to go. Whether it’s for building an emergency fund or investing in your retirement, every dollar you manage well works harder for you. It’s small, consistent actions that add up to big financial changes over time.

The 5 Key Skills For Effective Money Management

1. Budgeting

Budgeting is the foundation of effective money management and helps you understand how much money you bring in and where it is going. A well-planned budget allows you to allocate your funds and provides clarity, which helps you make informed decisions about your priorities. By regularly reviewing and adjusting your budget, you can adapt to changes and stay on track with your finances.

2. Tracking cash flow

It’s not enough to earn more than you spend, you need to track cash flow to ensure your income exceeds your expenses to pay bills as needed. Tracking cash flow keeps you proactive, preventing financial surprises and ensuring you always have enough cash to meet obligations and unexpected opportunities.

3. Debt management

Not all debt is created equal, and effective money management involves paying off high-interest bad debt. High interest credit cards and other debt drain your financial resources and keep you from building wealth, so pay off high interest debt as quickly as possible. Managing debt wisely reduces financial stress and allows for future financial growth.

4. Saving

Saving money creates a safety net for both planned and unplanned expenses. Saving for an emergency fund, buying a home, starting a business, or retiring comfortably provides a sense of security and purpose. Regularly setting aside even small amounts of money can add up over time and gives you confidence that you are prepared for unexpected life events.

5. Investing

Investing is the key to growing wealth. Investing allows you to grow your money through investment vehicles such as stocks, real estate, and ETFs. Smart investing involves understanding risk tolerance, diversifying your portfolio, and staying consistent. By putting your money to work, you create passive income and wealth accumulation that saving cannot give you.

The bottom line is that the path to riches starts with smart money management. It may not be the most exciting part of building wealth, but it is the most important. By mastering these key principles, you create a financial foundation that supports both your short and long-term growth. Remember, wealth is not built overnight, and it takes consistency and patience. Start today and watch your wealth grow.",neutral,neutral,0.9129417538642884,neutral,0.9784350395202636,neutral,0.9972684383392334,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.5725082159042358, 0.08666378259658813, 0.08232808858156204]",positive,0.5725082159042358
https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/01/16/the-art-of-building-a-lasting-financial-legacy-with-nontraditional-investments/,2025-01-16T12:45:00Z,"Anushree Jain is the CEO of Titan Global Technologies LLC.

Legacy goes beyond passing down assets. It’s about making a lasting impact that transcends generations, contributing to culture, society and the environment.

As investors, we have the opportunity to build legacies that reflect our values, passions and vision. This ensures that what we leave behind resonates beyond financial returns.

Intergenerational Wealth: Lessons From ‘Old Money’

Families with generational wealth often rely on nontraditional assets to preserve their financial stability over decades. Beyond traditional portfolios, their assets often include private equity, hedge funds, real estate and heirlooms. These investments diversify risk while carrying cultural and historical significance.

A hallmark of “old money” is intentionality in succession planning. For example, a family will pass down its heritage properties and art collection with care so that those remain symbols of values and continuity. Modern investors can adopt this principle by embracing alternative investments as part of their long-term wealth strategy.

The key lies in recognizing that legacy isn’t just about financial growth. It’s about preserving and passing on values and purpose.

Art And Collectibles: Timeless Narratives Of Wealth

Art and collectibles have long been intertwined with legacy. A curated collection is a statement of identity and vision.

Take art, for example. Masterpieces aren’t just financial investments. They preserve cultural significance and personal taste. The Rockefeller family’s art collections have adorned homes and museums alike, leaving a cultural imprint that resonates across generations. Similarly, collectibles such as rare books, vintage cars, handbags and luxury watches are expressions of identity-driven wealth.

Luxury watches have become a sought-after asset class, with several top-tier brands seeing impressive returns. Over the past few years, rare and limited-edition timepieces have performed well as investments, significantly outpacing traditional financial markets. From 2018 to 2023, luxury watches saw an annual price increase of about 20%, while the S&P 500 only rose by 8% in the same period.

Key brands including Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet have shown particularly remarkable returns. For instance, a Patek Philippe watch purchased between 2017 and 2022 could yield a return of 207%. These brands’ watches often appreciate due to their craftsmanship, rarity and brand legacy. The market for pre-owned luxury watches is projected to reach 35 billion Swiss francs ($38.4 billion) by 2030, demonstrating a growing interest in watches as an alternative investment.

I have a passion for collecting handbags. It’s fascinating to see how certain designer pieces have appreciated in value over time. Prices for iconic Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermes bags have increased significantly since 2019. These trends highlight how luxury handbags can appreciate over time, alongside traditional investments such as art.

The sophistication of India’s heritage is perhaps best reflected in the magnificent jewels that adorned the maharajas and their courts. Pieces such as the famed Patiala Necklace, crafted by Cartier for the Maharaja of Patiala, epitomize the confluence of extraordinary craftsmanship, rarity and opulence. These treasures were powerful symbols of legacy, often passed down through generations, embodying a family’s enduring influence and wealth. Such heirlooms remind us that true legacy lies in assets that carry stories, cultural depth and timeless value.

For contemporary investors, curating art or acquiring unique collectibles offers a dual benefit: financial appreciation and the chance to contribute to a broader narrative. Just as certain investments require time to reveal their potential, the ability to revisit and reframe our approach often leads to the greatest returns, both financially and in lasting impact. These investments serve as tangible representations of values and as enduring elements of one’s legacy.

Impact Funds: Aligning Wealth With Purpose

If art and collectibles represent personal expression, impact investing amplifies societal contribution. Impact funds channel capital into ventures that drive social or environmental change—such as renewable energy or affordable housing.

Unlike traditional investments, impact funds generate dual returns: financial performance and measurable social progress. For example, a fund supporting clean energy startups offers the potential for high financial returns as it contributes to addressing climate change. This approach resonates strongly with younger generations. Millennials and Gen Z investors increasingly prioritize investments that align with their values, viewing wealth as a tool for meaningful change. Impact investing blends purpose and profit so financial decisions contribute to a larger good.

Crafting Your Legacy Playbook

Building a strategy rooted in legacy requires thoughtful planning and execution. Here are four key steps to guide the process:

1. Identify your passions. Begin by reflecting on what matters most to you. Whether it’s sustainability, art or education, your investments should align with these priorities.

2. Collaborate with experts. Building a meaningful legacy often requires partnerships. Seek advice from art curators, fund managers or social entrepreneurs to identify opportunities that resonate with your goals. Consider selecting an investment firm with expertise in alternative investments. A firm that understands the nuances of these assets can help you make strategic choices that align with your vision for long-term impact.

3. Balance financial and emotional returns. Nontraditional investments require patience and foresight. Ensure your portfolio balances high-impact but slower-growth assets with more liquid options to maintain financial flexibility.

4. Plan for succession. Intergenerational wealth transfer is a critical part of legacy planning. Structuring nontraditional assets through trusts or other legal mechanisms can preserve them and maintain their long-term impact.

Nontraditional investments offer a chance to redefine wealth. They invite us to think beyond financial metrics and to focus instead on the narratives we craft and the impact we create. This presents an opportunity to take an “old money” approach to legacy building. Whether through art collections, impact funds or passion projects, these investments allow us to build legacies that resonate far beyond the material.

In the end, wealth may fade, but legacies—crafted with intention and vision—endure.

As women advance in their careers and reach new levels of financial success, they face a unique and complex landscape of opportunities and challenges. Today, some women are enjoying increased earnings as they progress in their fields, but any financial growth brings with it important decisions about saving, spending and balancing other responsibilities. While earning more can offer greater freedom and flexibility, it also calls for disciplined planning to ensure long-term financial security.

Financial Responsibilities: Supporting The Family

In one study, more than half of parents surveyed have prioritized giving financial help to their adult children over setting aside money for themselves. Many women feel inclined to assist their children financially, often putting family needs at the forefront of their spending decisions. Of course, men also support their families, and both men and women sometimes prioritize financial assistance for their children at the expense of their own retirement savings.

Though helping loved ones can be rewarding, it’s essential to prioritize personal financial health. This may mean taking a step back to ensure that spending on current needs like family support doesn’t hinder long-term goals. By viewing financial independence as a foundational goal, women can better navigate all their priorities without sacrificing security in their later years.

Financial Pitfalls Unique To Women

Women face distinct challenges in managing newfound wealth compared to men. Women may be more likely to spend on household and family-centered expenses. Additionally, women often spend more on clothing, accessories and home improvements than men, reflecting an emphasis on personal and domestic well-being.

This behavior, while often rooted in generosity and self-care, can become a financial pitfall if it diverts funds from personal saving goals. Data underscores the significance of these choices: Only 22% of women, on average, have $100,000 or more saved for retirement, while 30% of men do. This discrepancy is due in part to significantly lower lifetime earnings, as well as potential factors like career interruptions for caregiving or a tendency and/or need for some to prioritize family needs over personal savings.

Avoiding Shortfalls In Retirement

A common misconception is that traditional retirement savings accounts like 401(k)s will be sufficient for a secure retirement, but this may not always be the case. Women, who often live longer than men, may find that their retirement savings need to stretch further than anticipated. In fact, the average life expectancy difference between men and women means that women face greater pressure to sustain their resources over a potentially longer retirement.

One way to build a stronger foundation for retirement is to diversify savings beyond the standard 401(k) or IRA. Health savings accounts (HSAs), individual brokerage accounts and even real estate investments can offer a broader mix of resources. These additional savings avenues can help guard against the uncertainty of relying on a single type of retirement account, especially as life expectancy continues to rise in the U.S., albeit at a lower rate than other countries.

Broader Spending Patterns

As women’s incomes grow, often, so do the financial demands placed upon them—not only from family but also from societal expectations and problems. For instance, women spend more on healthcare costs. While healthcare spending often aligns with long-term well-being, it can strain financial resources if not managed within a balanced budget.

Bridging The Gender Savings Gap

While men and women share many common financial goals, their saving behaviors often differ in ways that affect long-term security. Data shows that women on average have saved about 30% less money by the time they retire compared to men. Addressing this gap requires addressing the gender wage and earnings gaps. In addition, women must also consider their personal financial future as a primary goal.

Based on my professional interactions, women who successfully balance supporting current responsibilities and personal future savings often report greater peace of mind about their financial future. This approach simply emphasizes the importance of making financial independence a priority so current spending needs are met from a position of strength.

Embracing Financial Independence

Establishing financial independence involves committing to a disciplined approach to both saving and spending. While it’s natural to want to improve one’s home or assist family members, as two examples, careful planning and a steady focus on personal security can provide a balanced path forward. Women who approach spending and saving with a focus on independence are better prepared for unexpected expenses, extended retirement needs and lifestyle changes that may arise later in life.

A Secure Financial Future

While some women today are well-positioned to make the most of rising earnings, it requires careful thought and consistent planning. Saving diligently, exploring diversified retirement strategies and balancing current needs and spending with personal financial goals are all essential steps for a secure future. By prioritizing long-term security, women can enjoy the rewards of their hard-earned success without compromising financial stability.

Embracing this balance empowers women to create lasting legacies for their families while ensuring that their own needs are met well into retirement. With a strategic and thoughtful approach, women can achieve both security and fulfillment as they progress in their careers and beyond.

In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, technology is not just a tool—it’s a transformative force reshaping financial processes and asset management. From IoT to artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and data analytics, cutting-edge innovations are enabling organizations to streamline operations, enhance decision-making and drive financial growth. This article explores the broader spectrum of technology’s impact on finance and offers actionable insights for business leaders to harness its potential effectively.

The Digital Transformation Of Financial Processes

Financial processes have traditionally been characterized by manual workflows, siloed data systems and a high risk of errors. However, the advent of advanced technologies has ushered in a new era of efficiency and precision. Key technological advancements driving this transformation include:

• Artificial Intelligence (AI) And Machine Learning (ML): Investment firms are increasingly leveraging AI to provide highly customized financial advice and portfolios tailored to each client's specific needs. For example, Man Group, a London-based hedge fund, developed ArcticDB, an internal tool designed to manage and analyze massive amounts of financial data, including tick data that tracks minute individual stock price changes. Bloomberg integrates ArcticDB into its BQuant analytics tools for financial services firms.

• Blockchain Technology: JPMorgan Chase has been developing blockchain-based solutions to enhance the financial services industry and innovate the exchange of money and other digital assets. Its blockchain group, Onyx, is involved in a pilot program enabling real-time transactions among a group of six banks in India. Additionally, Calastone, a London-based funds network and data business, utilizes blockchain technology to process £270 billion of investment value monthly, serving 4,000 clients across 57 countries.

• Cloud Computing: Financial services organizations are adopting cloud solutions to gain data-driven insights, enhance analytics, and ensure security and compliance. For instance, Google Cloud offers tailored solutions for financial institutions, facilitating real-time data processing and scalable financial applications. Moreover, 98% of organizations are using some form of cloud computing, up from 91% in 2020, indicating widespread adoption in the financial sector.

• Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Radius Financial Group, a mortgage lender, implemented RPA to streamline the mortgage application process, enhancing efficiency and reducing processing times. Similarly, Bancolombia utilized RPA to improve investment processes, demonstrating the technology's versatility in financial services.

• Data Analytics: American Express employs big data analytics to analyze and predict consumer behavior. By examining historical transactions and incorporating over 100 variables, the company utilizes sophisticated predictive models to enhance decision-making processes. This approach enables more accurate risk assessments and personalized customer experiences.

Practical Applications

Business leaders across industries are leveraging these technologies to revolutionize financial processes. Some practical applications include:

• Enhanced Budgeting And Forecasting: AI and data analytics tools allow organizations to create more accurate and dynamic financial forecasts. Machine learning models can adjust predictions based on real-time changes, providing leaders with a competitive edge.

• Fraud Detection And Prevention: Blockchain and AI can help identify anomalies and detect fraudulent activities. For example, AI algorithms can analyze transactional patterns to flag suspicious behavior, while blockchain ensures the authenticity of financial records.

• Optimized Cash Flow Management: RPA and data analytics provide real-time visibility into cash flow, enabling leaders to make informed decisions about investments, expenses and liquidity management.

• Streamlined Compliance: Technologies like RPA and AI simplify the process of regulatory compliance by automating reporting and ensuring accuracy in financial disclosures.

Why Business Leaders Should Embrace Technological Innovation

The integration of technology into financial processes is not merely an operational enhancement; it’s a strategic necessity. Here are key reasons why business leaders should prioritize technological adoption:

• Competitive Advantage: Leveraging technology enables businesses to outperform competitors through improved efficiency, faster decision-making and enhanced customer experiences.

• Risk Mitigation: Advanced technologies such as AI and blockchain minimize risks associated with fraud, human error and regulatory noncompliance.

• Scalability: Cloud computing and RPA provide scalable solutions that adapt to a company’s growth trajectory, ensuring financial systems can handle increasing complexity.

• Sustainability: By streamlining processes and reducing resource consumption, technologies contribute to sustainable financial practices.

Tips For Business Leaders

To maximize the benefits of technology in financial processes, business leaders should consider the following strategies:

• Assess Current Capabilities: Conduct a thorough assessment of existing financial systems to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.

• Invest In Training: Ensure employees are equipped with the skills needed to leverage new technologies effectively. Provide training programs and resources to facilitate adoption.

• Prioritize Security: Implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive financial data. This includes investing in secure cloud platforms and conducting regular audits.

• Collaborate With Experts: Partner with technology providers, consultants or industry experts to design and implement tailored solutions.

• Start With Pilot Projects: Test new technologies on a smaller scale before rolling them out fully. This strategy reduces risks and enables gradual refinements.

The Future Of Financial Processes

As technology continues to evolve, its impact on financial processes will only grow. Emerging trends such as quantum computing, advanced AI models and next-generation blockchain networks promise to redefine the financial landscape even further. Business leaders who embrace these innovations will be well-positioned to navigate the challenges of the future and seize new opportunities for growth.

In conclusion, technology is not just reshaping financial processes; it’s empowering business leaders to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency and achieve long-term success.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicamendoza1/2025/01/19/the-400k-wealth-gap-building-better-solutions-for-todays-renters/,2025-01-19T12:30:00Z,"America's rental market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with over 45 million renter households and an additional 9 million by 2040, projections show. However, this expansion comes with a stark wealth disparity: the average U.S. renter's net worth stands at $10,400, compared to homeowners at $400,000, according to The Aspen Institute's 2024 Profile on the Wealth and Financial Well-Being of Renter Households. As traditional wealth-building paths like homeownership become increasingly inaccessible, many renters are concerned about missing the opportunity to own a home. This shift presents businesses with a unique opportunity to address the financial needs of this growing demographic.

The financial profile of renters, as presented by The Aspen Institute Financial Security Program in their report, reveals a landscape of both challenges and opportunities. As only 39% of renter households report earning more than they spend—a significant contrast to 54% of homeowners—the potential for financial growth within this demographic is evident.

Homeowners traditionally hold a significant advantage in wealth-building, with 78% owning appreciating assets beyond their primary residence. In comparison, just 48% of renters have similar investments. However, a closer look at recent trends paints a more optimistic picture for renters: between 2019 and 2022, renters’ net worth grew by an impressive 43%, surpassing the 34% growth seen among homeowners during the same period.

This upward trajectory suggests that renters, often overlooked in conversations about wealth accumulation, are increasingly positioned to build and sustain financial security. Per The Aspen Institute report there are clear insights into how businesses can seize this opportunities:

Wealth-Building Tools

Savings and Investment Platforms: Micro-investment apps and savings tools tailored to renters can facilitate small, consistent contributions to savings and investment goals.

Retirement Planning Services: Solutions designed for renters can provide strategies to build long-term financial security without relying on home equity.

Alternative Asset Ownership Models: Models such as fractional real estate investing and rent-to-own programs allow renters to accumulate equity or gain exposure to real estate assets.

Debt Management Solutions: Renters often carry higher debt-to-income ratios. Services like debt consolidation, financial education, and AI-based budgeting tools can support debt reduction and management.

Housing Solutions

Affordable Housing Technology: The report highlights the need for increased affordable housing supply. Tech companies and startups could develop solutions to make housing construction more efficient and cost-effective.

Rental Management Platforms: There’s an opportunity for improved solutions for rent-management. Fast-growing startups, like BILT Rewards have taken a look at this market and helping renters build their credit score while gaining rewards. This sector will continue to expand and there are opportunities for improved property management software, tenant screening tools, and platforms that facilitate better landlord-tenant relationships.

Employee Benefits

Renter-Focused Benefits: Given that many employees are renters, corporate benefits can be expanded to consider renters’ needs, and provide tailored solutions. For example:

Rent payment assistance programs

Matched savings accounts for down payments

Financial counseling services focused on wealth-building for non-homeowners

Providing Multi-Stage Value

Renters represent a growing and diverse demographic, transitioning from early wealth-building to forming families and reaching new life milestones. Their financial journey evolves alongside these life changes, creating unique opportunities and challenges at each stage. Multi-stage financial products tailored to their evolving needs can provide the personalization and understanding required to support renters at every phase of their journey, from young professionals saving for their first home to families balancing multiple financial priorities.

The renter market is ripe with potential for innovation and meaningful impact, particularly as traditional financial products often overlook their specific circumstances.

And yet, adequate funding to scale operations remains a significant challenge for the 34 million small businesses in the US.1

Meet Bags, a startup founded by Daniel Taylor, Ignacio Semerene, and William Hayden, that launched in 2020, with a mission to bridge the capital divide by facilitating low-interest small business loans, particularly for minority-and women owned businesses.

Bags has raised $5 million to date, from investment firms Slauson & Co, Zeal Capital Partners, Google For StartUps, Connecticut Innovations, Schultz Family Foundation, Heirloom Ventures, Limited Ventures, Altrinsic Global Advisors and angel investor Richard Odior, and has used that seed funding to build out an AI-powered financial management platform and marketplace, connecting businesses to a vetted network of over 60 lenders.

Bags supports many different types of businesses, across CPG, services, retail and logistics - many of whom may not be retail bank worthy, but have anywhere from $100,000 to $30 million in revenue.

In a recently published Impact Report, Bags shared that working with a pilot cohort of 240 small businesses in 2024, they were able to see tremendous growth metrics: customers’ loan approval rates increased 4.5x, with a 5x faster funding timeline, facilitating enhanced business growth – 250% year-over-year, on average.

I spoke with CEO and co-founder Daniel Taylor, about the challenging small business funding landscape and how the Bags platform takes a holistic approach to financial growth.

A Closer Look At The Funding Problem

Most small businesses don’t have the cash flow and/or operating history to qualify for debt from traditional lenders or the SBA, and angel investment and venture capital is a difficult funding path reserved mostly for high-growth, tech companies. Thus, a majority rely on their personal savings and credit cards for capital to fund their business (2023 MetLife and US Chamber Small Business Index).

Taylor confirmed that, “what we're finding is most businesses are starting on credit cards…which creates a bit of a negative cycle because you start a business on a credit card and if you start to generate some cash flow…now your personal credit score is down, which makes it harder to get a loan.”

He also explained that the rising trend of leveraging merchant cash advances (MCAs) through payment processing platforms like Shopify, PayPal, Square and Stripe can be harmful for business growth. These platforms will qualify businesses for a loan quickly, and repayments are based on a percentage of daily sales - usually 10 - 20%, with higher rates reserved for riskier businesses. Unfortunately, these daily sweeps can cut into profit margins, making it dangerous for businesses who experience a drop in sales volume or an increase in cost of goods sold, or COGS (and thus lower margins).

Some businesses owners are forced to take out additional MCAs, just to cover the shortfall from the initial MCA. There’s an interesting Reddit forum dedicated to this entire topic: “The Downfall of My Business: Why I Regret Taking MCA Loans.” Taylor explained, “What kills a lot of businesses who are really good businesses is when they take out one MCA and a second and a third, and the next thing they know, 35% of their monthly revenues are being used to repay that MCA.”

In addition, MCA providers file a UCC on assets of the business, which securitizes the loan by giving them a priority lien on the business assets. This is essentially a scarlet letter for other traditional lenders who often refuse to fund businesses with MCAs.

And thus, ironically, the most frequented pathways to capital for many small businesses in the early days often preclude them from accessing affordable loans as they grow and mature.

An Overview Of The Bags Platform

Bags is a SaaS subscription-based platform that works closely with businesses on the financial management and book-keeping side, to help them better manage cash flow such that they can more easily qualify for loans with the lenders on their platform. As part of their financial dashboard, the company also offers AI-powered CFO-level insights and monthly reports to help owners assess business performance, as compared to historical financials and industry benchmarks.

On the lending side, they offer a range of loan products in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $30 million, by working with carefully vetted partners, including private credit, community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, community banks and fintechs. CDFIs are mission-driven lenders, often federally funded, that target underserved communities and businesses that may not qualify for traditional financing, and can provide low-interest term loans, ranging from 4 - 6% APR.

Beyond the interest rates, Taylor explained that “we look at the loan documentation, we look at their typical terms, including covenants, we look at what it takes to be approved and then we decide, is this a product that is on par or better than a product that we currently have.”

Taylor emphasized that “there are a lot of predatory products that are out there” and believes Bags has a critical role to play in helping to protect small businesses from those types of products.

Bags offers subscriptions, starting at $280 / month with increasing tiers based on the size of business and level of financial management required.",neutral,neutral,0.7804309129714966,positive,0.5180163383483887,positive,0.9790942072868348,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.6072109043598175, 0.04916677810251713, 0.0180879837134853]",positive,0.6072109043598175
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2025/01/28/utility-etfs-american-superconductor-look-to-benefit-from-trumps-orders/,2025-01-28T15:40:20Z,"In his first week in office, President Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders addressing a variety of growing industries including artificial intelligence, digital financial technology, and energy production.

Trump declared a national energy emergency and said the nation’s energy infrastructure needs to expedite energy and infrastructure projects. He removed regulations that have limited the generation of reliable and affordable energy and barriers hindering the growth of AI. One order seeks to strengthen America’s leadership in digital financial technology by promoting blockchain, digital assets and emerging financial technologies, such as cryptocurrency.

Altogether, these industries are significantly boosting the demand for datacenters where computing power is centralized and easily accessible. These large physical facilities house computer servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other infrastructure designed to store, manage, and distribute data.

Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta Platforms (META), announced Meta will increase its capital spending this year by up to $65 billion to cover the costs of AI and a massive new data center in Louisiana “so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan” and bring one gigawatt of computing power online.

The boost in data centers is driving demand higher for electricity, up from an already strained national electrical grid system having difficulty keeping up with current demand. Last month, the Department of Energy estimated that data center load growth is projected to “double or triple” by 2028.

According to a recent white paper from the Electric Power Research Institute, by 2030, electricity usage by hyperscalers is expected to consume up to 9% of U.S. electricity generation, up from 4% today. Last year, PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electric Company), one of the largest natural gas and electric utilities in the U.S., said it expects demand for electricity to grow by 70% over the next two decades.

While this may change due to the introduction of a new AI from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, as of today this is unknown. Meanwhile, the way to profit off this growth is to buy an ETF that holds a portfolio of utility stocks. Last year, these funds saw returns close to the 24.9% seen in the S&P 500 Index.

· The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) holds all the utility stocks in the S&P 500. According to Morningstar, it jumped 23.3% in 2024 and was up 5% year to date before yesterday’s stock-market rout brought it down to 2.6%, which may present a buying opportunity.

· The iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (IDU) climbed 23.2% in 2024 and 4.8% year to date as of Friday (all numbers from Morningstar).

· The Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU) gained 23.1% in 2024 and 4.8% as of Jan. 25.

· Virtus Reaves Utilities ETF (UTES), an actively managed fund soared 45.3% last year and 14% as of Jan. 25.

· Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) invests in companies to benefit from a potential increase in infrastructure activity in the USA. It rose 17.9% last year and 8.1% as of Jan. 25.

The growth potential for sizable infrastructure buildouts in the utilities sector is large. Yet, in the meantime, utilities are forced to push the existing grid to its limit to meet today’s demands.

One company that helps utilities boost their power between the grid and the end user is American Superconductor (AMSC). The Ayer, Mass. company makes it easier for other companies to connect reliable energy so the grid can accept it by ensuring the right voltage, the right frequency, power quality, power conditions, and power connection.

“We help the grid do things it’s not ready to do and more of what it already does,“ Daniel P. McGahn, chairman, president and chief executive of AMSC, told Forbes.com in an interview. The end users must be able to power their facilities in ways that add scale without adding complexity or size. McGahn said AMSC’s products are uniquely positioned to address this market demand. This demand also comes from charging electric vehicles and the building of fabrication plants funded by the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act of 2022. “We make it more secure, much more resilient, and look for problems.”

McGahn estimated that 50% of the company’s financial growth will come from industrials and chips, 30% from renewables, specifically wind turbines, and the remaining 20% from the military.

AMSC’s products include:

· Electrical Control System for wind turbines which maximizes the turbines’ power generation

· Transmission Voltage Management for connecting renewable energy to the grid

· Resilient Electric Grid Systems which increase the reliability of urban grids

· Distribution Voltage Optimization to control voltage and allow utilities to distribute generated energy.

· Power Electronics and Control Systems, which mitigates power quality issues and corrects harmonic distortion.

· Power Supply which provides primary power to industrial equipment and ships

· Ship Protection Systems, a magnetic system that interferes with an underwater mines ability to detect and damage a ship.

“We condition the equipment to bring together disparate sources and disparate loads,” said McGahn. “ We condition the power to be useful for the equipment at the site.”

In 2024, AMSC’s stock soared 125% on strong organic revenue growth, and the purchase of NWL, which provides power supplies to industrial and military customers. The stock closed the year at $25.02, down from a 52-week high of $36.81. Monday’s AI rout sent the stock tumbling 10% to $26.03.

For the second fiscal quarter ended September 30, AMSC reported revenue grew 60% year over year to $54.5 million. AMSC also posted its first profit, $4.9 million, or $0.13 a share, compared to a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.09 a share, for the same period in 2023.

AMSC plans to report results for the December 2024 quarter in the first half of February. The company expects revenues will be between $55.0 million to $60.0 million. It forecasts a net loss for the fiscal third quarter to not exceed $1.0 million, or $0.03 a share.",neutral,positive,0.90521639585495,positive,0.978367030620575,positive,0.999711573123932,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.2860778532922268, 0.38307736814022064, 0.03909552376717329]",negative,0.38307736814022064

For companies, this shift presents a chance to attract conscientious investors—but it requires them to adapt their operations, reporting and strategies to meet new expectations.

To that end, 18 Forbes Finance Council members share their insights on how ESG investments impact portfolio performance and risk—and how companies can better prepare for them. Their perspectives provide actionable strategies for integrating ESG principles into business practices so you can position your organization for success in a changing market.

1. Tap Into The Green Economy

The green economy represents a trillion-dollar addressable market. To benefit from this new revenue opportunity, companies are adapting their product lines and evolving their operational practices. Preparation requires evaluating intellectual capital, reinvesting in new infrastructure and aligning product strategy with changing consumer preferences. - Martin Jarzebowski, CFA, Federated Hermes

2. Establish Clear ESG Commitments

Because many investors prefer defined sustainability measurement along with their overall asset performance, companies with strong ESG beliefs are good at attracting long-term investment support. Preparation based on solid data reporting, clear communication and firm stakeholder commitment in ESG can lead to higher levels of investment interest. - Jeffrey Bartel, Hamptons Group, LLC

3. Connect Operations With Sustainability Expectations

By lowering long-term risks associated with environmental, social and governance concerns—and possibly raising profits from sustainable growth sectors—ESG-focused investments can improve portfolio performance. Companies should prioritize transparent reporting, incorporate ESG measurements into financial planning and connect operations with investor sustainability expectations to get ready. - Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc.

4. Create Real-World Value

ESG-focused investments, when done right, can fuel innovation and uncover massive opportunities while minimizing long-term risks. It's not just about checking boxes—it's about creating value by solving real-world problems. Companies need to think big, embed ESG into their core strategy and build solutions that scale. Focus on impact, not optics, and the returns will follow. - Shivali Kukreja , NIB NZ

5. Align Capital With Sustainability Goals

Companies with strong ESG practices are often eligible for green bonds or sustainability-linked loans with favorable terms. This boosts portfolio returns while lowering default risks. Companies should establish robust ESG certifications, engage in green initiatives and align their capital structures with sustainability goals. - Neil Anders, Trusted Rate, Inc.

6. Conduct Frequent Impact Assessments

Diversifying an investor portfolio with ESG investments boosts performance by reducing risks tied to environmental, social and governance challenges while promoting sustainable growth and resilience during market volatility. To prepare, companies should integrate ESG metrics into their strategies, perform regular impact assessments and maintain transparency to meet stakeholder expectations. - Nike Ajao, OneBarrow Corp.

7. Consider ESG ETFs

Investing in sustainable ESG companies, whether related to your company or your suppliers, has many benefits all around. However, if your core strength is not on the investment front, your company may want to consider investing in an ESG ETF. This will give you all the marketing and profitability benefits while mitigating the risks and fees involved in building your own portfolio. - David T. Nudelman, Scandinavian Capital Markets

8. Prioritize Sustainability For Long-Term Value

ESG-focused investments can significantly impact a portfolio's performance and risk. One way ESG factors influence portfolio performance is through the long-term value creation of companies that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices. Companies with strong ESG practices tend to have better risk management and more sustainable business models, and they can attract loyal customers and employees. - Bob Chitrathorn, Wealth Planning By Bob Chitrathorn of Simplified Wealth Management

9. Establish Measurable Goals

ESG-focused investments enhance portfolio performance by reducing risks and ensuring business sustainability over generations. Companies with strong ESG practices adapt better to regulatory, environmental and social changes, creating stable, long-term returns. To prepare, businesses should embed ESG principles, focus on transparency and set measurable goals, building resilience. - Amit Jain, Dhruva Advisors (USACFO)

10. Adopt GRI Or SASB Frameworks

ESG-focused investments reduce long-term risk by addressing resource scarcity, regulatory shifts and social expectations while driving performance through consumer and investor trust. As markets prioritize sustainability, ESG is the future, aligning profitability with impact. Companies must adopt frameworks like GRI or SASB, set measurable goals and embed ESG to stay competitive and resilient. - Trixy Castro, TRX Capital

11. Support Investor Preferences

As investor preferences shift towards more sustainable and responsible investments, companies with strong ESG practices may benefit from increased investor demand and higher valuations. - JD Morris, RHC 21 LLC (a SPE Fund) with family of Special Purpose Entities (SPE or SPV)

12. Integrate ESG Metrics

ESG-focused investments enhance portfolio stability by reducing exposure to environmental and governance risks while capturing sustainable growth opportunities. Companies should prepare by integrating ESG metrics into decision-making, fostering accountability and staying ahead of regulatory trends. - Sumeet Grover, Alliant

13. Communicate Progress To Stakeholders

ESG investments can reduce downside risks while uncovering new growth opportunities. They help avoid issues like regulatory fines or reputational damage and often lead to more stable returns. To stay ready, companies should embed ESG into their business models, set clear goals and communicate their progress effectively to investors and stakeholders. - Michael Foguth, Foguth Financial Group

14. Leverage Life Insurance

ESG-focused investments can stabilize portfolio performance by reducing risks tied to governance or environmental issues. Companies should better prepare by using life insurance as an asset class, leveraging tax-deferred growth and income-free use of cash value and providing liquidity to offset ESG risks while aligning with sustainable goals for resilience. - Andre Pennington, Pennington Law

15. Avoid Greenwashing

ESG practices actually predate the term itself. Corporate social responsibility, strong governance and energy efficiency have long been valued. Investing in companies with such practices helps reduce risk. Recently, however, there has been a rise in greenwashing, where ESG is simply used as a branding tactic. Investors should stay away from projects with such practices. - Lechi (Richard) Zhang, Stonelake Capital

16. Provide Transparent Reporting

ESG-focused investments can boost portfolio performance by driving sustainable growth and reducing risks like regulatory fines or reputational harm. They provide stability in volatile markets. Companies should prepare by integrating ESG into their operations, enhancing transparency in reporting and addressing key environmental, social and governance challenges to meet stakeholder expectations. - Ravi Gullapalli, Fastra Investments

17. Implement Accountability Structures

ESG-focused investments strengthen portfolios by aligning value creation with global sustainability imperatives. They reduce exposure to systemic risks while driving innovation and unlocking new market opportunities. Companies should adopt tailored ESG strategies, leverage data analytics to assess progress and establish accountability frameworks to achieve measurable impact and confidence. - Anushree Jain, Titan

18. Highlight Your Dedication To Sustainability

Investing with an ESG focus helps portfolios by reducing risks like regulatory challenges and reputational issues while capitalizing on opportunities in sustainable markets. To better attract investors, companies should integrate ESG factors into their strategies, enhance reporting and demonstrate a clear commitment to sustainability for stronger competitive positioning. - Ivan Lunegov, Olimp Capital Partners

https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/01/22/the-future-of-organizational-success-how-cultural-portfolio-management-addresses-deis-shortcomings/,2025-01-22T15:30:00Z,"David D. Ireland, Ph.D., is a global expert in leadership and building inclusive cultures, serving as the CEO of Belong Group.

In the last decade, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives have evolved from being corporate buzzwords to becoming central pillars of organizational culture. However, despite its noble intentions, DEI has increasingly been hijacked by political forces and competing agendas, distorting its original purpose. This co-opting has led to DEI initiatives that often alienate key stakeholders, particularly White men, and focus on check-box exercises rather than meaningful change.

It is time for a reset—a new approach that preserves the core of DEI but strips away the politicization and divisiveness. Enter Cultural Portfolio Management (CPM), a framework that emphasizes cultural strengths, diverse backgrounds, and cultural intelligence without the political baggage. Just as a financial portfolio manager balances a range of assets for optimal returns, a Cultural Portfolio Manager strategically curates and integrates diverse cultural perspectives to foster innovation, collaboration and, ultimately, business success.

It’s clear that the original vision of DEI has been blurred. What was once about creating fair, welcoming and inclusive workplaces has too often become a platform for competing ideological agendas. Many corporations—once committed to building diverse teams—are quietly pulling back their DEI initiatives. These organizations and dozens of universities have chosen to dismantle their DEI efforts after finding that the strategies in place were either ineffective or causing more division than unity.

I argue that the problem isn't with diversity, equity or inclusion itself, but with how the initiative has been framed and communicated. The rise of “woke” terminology, Critical Race Theory and accusatory tones toward certain demographics—particularly White men—has resulted in increased resistance and disengagement from DEI programs.

We must toss out the bathwater of politically charged DEI strategies but keep the baby of cultural inclusiveness and intelligence. Cultural Portfolio Management is how we do that.

Cultural Portfolio Management (CPM) is a strategic approach to managing and optimizing the diverse cultural assets of an organization. Like a financial portfolio manager who diversifies assets to mitigate risk and maximize return, a Cultural Portfolio Manager leverages the varied racial and cultural backgrounds within an organization to create a thriving, innovative and adaptable workplace. The ultimate goal? To maximize the organization’s revenue potential and stay competitive in an ever-evolving global market.

CPM avoids the politicized connotations associated with traditional DEI initiatives by focusing on cultural intelligence, collaborative practices and strategic inclusion. This new approach speaks to all employees—regardless of race, gender or background—and unites them toward a common business goal.

The Top Five Functions Of A Cultural Portfolio Manager

To understand the true value of CPM, let’s consider the top five functions of a Cultural Portfolio Manager:

1. Cultural Strategy Development

The Cultural Portfolio Manager develops and implements strategies that align cultural diversity with the organization’s broader mission and business goals. By assessing the current cultural climate and identifying gaps, this manager sets clear, measurable objectives that promote inclusivity and support long-term success.

2. Cultural Asset Allocation And Integration

Just as a financial manager allocates assets to maximize returns, the Cultural Portfolio Manager evaluates and integrates diverse cultural competencies across departments. This ensures that diverse perspectives are not only present but fully utilized to drive innovation and solve complex business problems.

3. Cultural Risk Management

Cultural misalignment or conflict is a risk to any organization. A skilled Cultural Portfolio Manager proactively addresses potential issues, from unconscious bias to cross-cultural misunderstandings. By fostering a respectful and harmonious workplace, they reduce the risk of cultural tensions while promoting a productive work environment where team members feel a deep sense of belonging.

4. Performance Monitoring And Adjustments

Tracking cultural performance is key to success. The manager regularly evaluates key metrics—such as employee engagement, retention rates and innovation outputs—to make data-driven adjustments. Companies with inclusive cultures report a reduction in employee turnover and higher employee satisfaction. In essence, diversity buoys employee retention. This ensures that the organization's cultural strategy remains aligned with its evolving needs and market conditions.

5. Stakeholder Communication And Reporting

Transparency is essential. The Cultural Portfolio Manager communicates cultural initiatives and progress to both internal and external stakeholders, presenting data-driven insights that demonstrate the tangible benefits of cultural diversity. This transparency builds trust and reinforces the organization’s commitment to inclusivity. A tangible byproduct of diversity, according to a 2018 Harvard Business Review finding, is that it garners a 70% increase in the likelihood of capturing new markets.

The Business Case For Cultural Portfolio Management

Organizations that fail to adapt to the evolving landscape of workplace diversity will be left behind. DEI, as it currently exists, is no longer enough—its political baggage has caused alienation and resistance in many companies like Meta, Tesla, DoorDash, Lyft, and Home Depot. However, CPM presents a solution that moves beyond political divides and focuses on what really matters: fostering a high-performance culture that drives innovation and engagement. Non-monocultural organizations are also 35% more likely to have financial growth above their national industry medians.

Recent studies consistently show that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones in terms of problem-solving, decision-making, and increased revenue from innovation. CPM enables organizations to harness these benefits while avoiding the traps of traditional DEI initiatives. By emphasizing cultural intelligence and strategic inclusivity, CPM is not just a moral imperative but a business one.

Conclusion: The Time For Change Is Now

The business world can no longer afford to ignore the cracks in traditional DEI programs. Political agendas and divisive rhetoric have tainted the original goals of fairness and inclusion. CPM offers a fresh, strategic approach that is free from the social and political baggage of DEI, while still delivering on the promise of a more inclusive and innovative workplace.

As we move forward, organizations must take bold steps to embrace CPM and reap the rewards of a truly diverse and culturally intelligent workforce. Defunding your DEI program may seem like the easy choice, but the real investment lies in building your CPM strategy. In a rapidly evolving world, you can’t afford to sit this one out—your future success depends on it.",neutral,neutral,0.6472711265087128,neutral,0.9777366518974304,negative,0.9924880266189576,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.6751086115837097, 0.13475573807954788, 0.035394351463764906]",positive,0.6751086115837097
https://www.forbes.com/sites/unique-properties/2025/01/24/unlocking-long-term-investment-potential-for-foreign-nationals-in-the-uae/,2025-01-24T14:15:07Z,"In 2019, the UAE introduced its Golden Visa, an initiative offering long-term residency options to qualified individuals, allowing them to build their homes and businesses in the country, knowing their future is secure. The category was created to offer entrepreneurs, investors, and highly skilled individuals residing in the country the opportunity to truly call the UAE their home. It was also designed to attract foreign nationals seeking a foothold in one of the world’s most progressive and thriving economies.

In the six years since its launch, the program has evolved, and its appeal to investors has increased exponentially. The UAE’s booming real estate market is an attractive draw, with 64% of global HNWIs expressing an interest in UAE property investment. The prospects for long-term growth and considerable return on investment across the market are evident. Dubai is particularly favourable for investors, offering approximately 91 sqm of prime residential space for $1 million—over double the 43 sqm available for the same price in Sydney and nearly three times what is attainable in New York. With the addition of the Golden Visa, the nation has become a hotspot for overseas investment.

An Overview of the UAE’s Golden Visa Program

Conceived as part of the UAE’s vision to drive innovation and foster economic diversification, the Golden Visa program also makes the nation a magnet for global talent and wealth. Unlike traditional short-term visas, the Golden Visa provides five- or ten-year renewable residency options, granting holders the stability that is often a driving factor when investing. No sponsorship is required by a local company, marking it different from regular visa holders.

Eligible categories of the visa span property investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, researchers, and talented individuals from various fields, including arts, medicine, and technology. This inclusivity ensures the program attracts a diverse pool of contributors to the UAE’s ambitious economic agenda.

Benefits for Foreign Investors

The Golden Visa offers a range of benefits that make it an appealing proposition for investors. For instance, a purchase of a home worth AED 2 million (approximately $545,000) will make one eligible for a five-year renewable visa, while investment of the same capital in a commercial venture offers access to the ten-year renewable visa.

Golden Visa holders enjoy the freedom of unrestricted entry and exit from the country, enabling them to operate with ease in the UAE’s pro-business environment.

The UAE is also renowned for its high quality of living, and the Golden Visa grants access to world-class healthcare, education, and advanced infrastructure, which makes it attractive to families. As reflected in Knight Frank’s most recent Dubai Residential Market Review, 43% of global HNWIs with personal wealth of more than $15 million would like to buy a house in Dubai for their personal use.

The added advantage of tax-free living further strengthens the appeal of investing in the UAE.

Real Estate Opportunities

A key pathway to obtaining the Golden Visa is through property investment. The minimum threshold for investment is AED 2 million, which can secure an apartment in the highly desirable Dubai Marina or a villa in Dubai South, which shows huge potential for ROI.

Prime Locations for UAE Property Investment

Downtown Dubai, Dubai Marina, and Palm Jumeirah continue to attract international investors with their luxurious lifestyle offerings, excellent facilities, and lucrative rental returns. These neighborhoods epitomize the city’s appeal as a world-class destination for real estate investment.

The surge in luxury real estate demand, driven by Golden Visa holders and HNWIs, has also reshaped Dubai’s property market. According to The Knight Frank Prime Global Cities Index Q3 2024, prime residential property prices in Dubai saw a 16.9% annual change. The long-term residency provided by the Golden Visa has encouraged investors to shift from rentals to property purchases, further boosting market activity.

Economic Impact of the Golden Visa

The Golden Visa supports the UAE’s broader vision of economic diversification and sustainability, as outlined in the Dubai Economic Agenda ‘D33’. This plan reinforces the city's commitment to economic growth and its goal of becoming a leading global city by 2030.

Since the visa has been available, it has driven growth in the secondary property market, attracting investment into both luxury and mid-tier developments. Additionally, the program has positioned the UAE as a hub for global talent, drawing top professionals and entrepreneurs, thereby fostering a competitive, innovation-driven economy.

According to Henley & Partners, the UAE was projected to welcome 6,700 new millionaires in 2024 alone, reinforcing its status as a leading destination for high-net-worth families.

Beyond Real Estate: Expanding Investment HorizonsWhile real estate remains a cornerstone, Golden Visa holders are also exploring opportunities in various other sectors. The UAE’s strategic location and robust connectivity make it an ideal launchpad for entrepreneurs and innovators seeking access to global markets.

How the UAE Compares Globally

While several countries, such as Portugal and Malta, also offer golden visa programs, the UAE's proposition stands out due to several key factors. One of the major advantages is the tax-free income policy, as the UAE does not impose an income tax, providing a substantial financial benefit for investors. Additionally, the stability of the AED, which is fixed to the US dollar, ensures a secure and predictable investment environment. The UAE also excels in its business-friendly regulatory framework, consistently ranking among the top nations globally for ease of doing business. This combination of financial advantages and a transparent, investor-friendly system makes the UAE’s Golden Visa program particularly attractive.

A Gateway to Growth

As the UAE continues to solidify its reputation as a global hub for business and luxury living, the Golden Visa program offers an ideal opportunity for foreign investors. Aside from the benefits and stability of residency, it offers the possibility of long-term personal and financial growth and the chance to be part of the UAE’s transformative vision for the future.

The property market of the UAE is still quite young and highly dynamic, hence it is advisable for investors to partner with credible advisors to mitigate risks and make well-informed decisions.",neutral,positive,0.6765856742858887,neutral,0.9062856435775756,positive,0.999312698841095,"['positve', 'neutral', 'negative']","[0.8648708164691925, 0.012897624168545008, 0.0018720956868492067]",positive,0.8648708164691925

Risk-averse business buyers weigh vendor credibility in their purchase decisions and prefer to partner with trusted, established vendors. Therefore, any kind of reputational harm can damage a B2B company’s demand gen funnel, with negative perceptions spreading rapidly through professional networks and industry forums.

Conversely, since B2B sales typically involve multiple stakeholders and longer cycles, a strong brand reputation can act as a critical trust accelerator, significantly reducing friction in the buying process. Here, 17 members of Forbes Agency Council explore how a B2B brand can ensure its reputation positively impacts demand generation by giving prospects confidence in the company’s ability to deliver value.

1. Bridge Demand Gen And Lead Gen With Reputation

We see reputation as the bridge between demand gen and lead gen. Reputation plays an important role in elevating brand awareness within the horizontal and key vertical segments of a B2B company. Demand gen only lacks the credibility of third-party attribution. Combine the two awareness generators, and the typical sales funnel becomes a thought leadership funnel with greater lead gen adoption. - Dean Trevelino, Trevelino/Keller

2. Invest In Consistent Messaging And Quality Content

Especially for niche and complex B2B products with long sales cycles, the brand reputation you build today directly influences future demand. A strong, consistent brand reduces perceived risk and speeds up decision-making. So invest in long-term brand reputation. Ensure consistent messaging and a flow of quality content that delivers strategic insights and anticipates your audience’s needs. - Alexa West, Aspectus Group

3. Build Strong Social Profiles For Ongoing ORM

The first step is building strong social profiles as part of ongoing online reputation management. That will help dominate the search results when someone searches for the company. The next step is promoting unique company content—case studies and research, for example—across those profiles as part of a multi-touch audience campaign. This helps build trust in the brand as potential customers move through the buying funnel. - Toren Ajk, TAC Marketing Group

4. Be Quick To Respond To Leads

One step to ensure your branding positively impacts demand gen efforts is to be responsive. For most businesses, the brand is how the company communicates and delivers services. It’s not about logos. When demand gen produces a lead, be quick to respond. This will convey so much about your brand. Allowing leads to sit for days and weeks also says a lot about your brand. Be smart. - T. Maxwell, eMaximize

5. Integrate Social Proof Into Your Marketing

Integrating social proof into your marketing is essential to a B2B company’s demand generation efforts. Capture customer testimonials and record case studies and integrate them into your messaging across platforms. What others say about your business is much more powerful than what you say about your business. Don’t overdo it, but do include social proof in your social media channels, email marketing and media. - Jonathan Schwartz, Bullseye Strategy

6. Educate Your Audience

Educate, don’t sell. Position your brand as a thought leader by sharing actionable insights that solve your audience’s biggest pain points. Trust drives demand—not the other way around. - Isadora Marlow Morgan, Isadora Agency

7. Address Core Industry Challenges Via Thought Leadership

By consistently publishing thought leadership content that addresses your industry’s core challenges, you can transform your company from a vendor into a trusted advisor—which naturally attracts prospects when they’re ready to buy. For example, if you’re a SaaS company, releasing research on how AI is reshaping productivity, backed by actionable insights, positions you as an industry expert. - Rory Holland, CSTMR Fintech Marketing & Design Agency

8. Learn What Matters Most To Your Customers

Take the time to understand your customer better than anyone else. Your brand’s reputation is built on its promise and experience. So, everything you say, everything you publish and everything you do should reflect your customers’ priorities and demonstrate that you know their needs. There’s no shortcut. You have to be obsessed with learning what matters most to the people who matter most to you. - Howard Breindel, DeSantis Breindel

9. Give Marketing Teams Time To Dial Up Brand Reputation

Current benchmarks for marketing success often drive a focus on short-term activity. But building brand trust, credibility and relatability doesn’t happen overnight, and progress can’t always be measured by short-term metrics. B2B companies need to give marketing teams more time to turn up the dial on brand reputation, which will have a longer-term impact on demand generation. - Nikos Lemanis, Luxid

10. Don’t Underestimate Word-Of-Mouth

Word-of-mouth has a huge influence in B2B. Many marketers hate to admit this, as they like the comfort of data and attribution models, despite almost every B2B prospect having a network that can offer advice. By building positive brand perceptions, companies reduce perceived risk and encourage far stronger word-of-mouth. Building a brand can’t fail to improve demand generation. - Mike Maynard, Napier Partnership Limited

11. Show Consumers Why You Are A Fit

One of the great things about B2B business is you know exactly who your consumer is and is not. Find them where they are and be human, direct, thoughtful, creative and value-laden. Seek them out, listen and show them why you are a fit. And of course, don’t be lazy. They have seen laziness a thousand times. Replacing logos on a deck won’t work most of the time. Eventually, your reputation will precede you. - Jon Bier, Jack Taylor

12. Foster Strong Client Relationships

Fostering strong client relationships through regular communication reinforces loyalty and provides opportunities to ask for testimonials and case studies. Showcasing these success stories through thought leadership and on social media demonstrates credibility and positions the company as a trusted partner, boosting demand generation through referrals and increased brand confidence. - Karolyn Raphael, Winger Marketing

13. Deliver High-Quality, Actionable Insights

A powerful step a B2B company can take to ensure its brand reputation positively impacts demand generation is to position itself as a trusted industry authority through strategic thought leadership and value-driven content. By consistently delivering high-quality, actionable insights, the company establishes itself as a go-to resource for solving key industry challenges. - Jonathan Johnson, Streamline Results

14. Help Prospects Solve Their Problems For Free

Focus on creating educational, high-value content that proves you can solve your audience’s problems. When you provide real insights and help them for free, you build trust and attract the right prospects. In our campaigns, over 2,500 people get educated for every one who books a demo. A value-first approach like this strengthens your brand reputation and drives demand naturally. - Alex Khassa, Clients Blackbox, Inc.

15. Leverage Customer Testimonials And Success Stories

Make use of customer testimonials and success stories. Giving clients tangible instances of how your solutions have improved their lives not only increases trust, but also demonstrates the worth of your products. Peer validation is a common factor in the decision-making process of potential customers, and well-written case studies or reviews can successfully close the awareness-to-conversion gap. - Christena Garduno, Media Culture

16. Communicate How You Help Customers

Too often, business owners focus communications on their own achievements and financial growth. They need to prioritize communicating how they help customers instead, using real-world examples that demonstrate the company’s understanding of customer challenges and its true, quantifiable impact on customer success. - Thomas Faust, Stanton

17. Focus On Building Trust By Delivering Value",neutral,neutral,0.7542263865470886,positive,0.999999701976776,positive,0.9993888437747956,"['positve', 'neutral', 'negative']","[0.6619407832622528, 0.023853047750890255, 0.04653102345764637]",positive,0.6619407832622528

Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is a simple way to grow your money and get involved in the crypto economy without needing big investments upfront. From staking coins to participating in yield farming to earning “bitcoin back” credit card rewards, there are multiple ways to generate returns without actively trading crypto. This article explores popular methods for earning passive crypto income, their risks and rewards, and tips to maximize earnings. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a crypto-curious beginner, you’ll find actionable insights to start your journey.

Can You Earn Passive Income With Cryptocurrency?

Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is possible and increasingly popular. Unlike traditional savings, crypto income strategies often provide higher returns by utilizing blockchain’s decentralized infrastructure. Methods like staking and lending allow users to earn rewards while supporting network operations or facilitating loans.

The appeal lies in diversifying income streams and taking advantage of the booming crypto ecosystem. With proper knowledge, passive crypto income can become a viable alternative for financial growth. However, risks like market volatility and platform reliability must be carefully considered before diving in.

Popular Methods For Earning Passive Income With Crypto

Explore these proven strategies to earn passive crypto income and understand their benefits and risks.

Staking

Staking involves locking your cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to support transaction validation and earn rewards. It’s common in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) networks like Ethereum 2.0, Cardano and Polkadot.

Popular platforms like Binance, Kraken and Coinbase simplify staking, promising consistent returns. Benefits include low barriers to entry and network security contribution. However, risks include volatility and potential loss if networks fail or are attacked. Staking rewards typically range from 5-20% annually depending on the coin and platform.

Yield Farming

Yield farming, or liquidity mining, involves providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms exchange for rewards. Users deposit crypto into liquidity pools, earning transaction fees or additional tokens.

While yield farming generally offers higher returns than staking, risks are higher. Smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss, and volatile token values can negatively impact gains. Research platforms carefully and use reliable tools like MetaMask or Ledger wallets for security.

Lending

Crypto lending platforms decentralized protocols allow users to earn interest by lending crypto to borrowers. These platforms match lenders with borrowers, paying interest on deposits.

Returns often range between 5-15%, making lending an attractive option. Risks include platform insolvency, fluctuating collateral values and regulatory uncertainty. Evaluate lending terms and ensure the platform complies with robust security and compliance standards.

Interest Through Crypto Savings Accounts

Crypto savings accounts function like traditional accounts but with higher yields. These accounts often provide flexibility, letting users withdraw at any time, though fixed-term options may offer higher returns. Risks include platform security and interest rates affected by crypto market dynamics.

Crypto Mining

Mining involves using computational power to validate blockchain transactions, earning crypto rewards. Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are popular, though hardware costs and energy consumption make entry expensive.

New miners can explore cloud mining or altcoin mining for lower barriers. While profitable during bull markets, profitability depends on electricity costs, hardware efficiency and market conditions.

Running A Masternode

Masternodes are specialized nodes requiring significant crypto collateral to operate. They help manage blockchain governance and offer consistent rewards. While rewards can be substantial, masternodes require technical expertise and high initial investment. Market volatility and network changes may impact returns.

Tips For Maximizing Your Passive Earnings

Diversify Your Strategies

Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across multiple crypto income methods. For example, combine staking with lending or yield farming to balance potential rewards and risks. This approach ensures that no single failure significantly impacts your portfolio.

Research Before Investing Into A Method

Understanding the platform, network, and risks is crucial. Use reputable sources to evaluate opportunities, including technical documentation and user reviews. Verify platform security, compliance and historical performance before committing funds.

Start Small And Scale Gradually

Begin with small investments to minimize risks and learn from experience. As you gain confidence and expertise, scale your investments for larger returns. This cautious approach protects your capital while building knowledge.

Watch Out For Scams

The rapid growth of cryptocurrency has brought incredible opportunities—but also countless scams. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of crypto makes it a prime target for fraudsters. By understanding the risks and knowing the red flags, you can protect yourself and your investments.

Common scams include pump-and-dump schemes, where bad actors inflate a coin’s value to attract buyers before selling off their holdings, causing the price to crash. Phishing attacks are another common tactic, where fake emails or websites are designed to steal your credentials or wallet keys. Imposter giveaways promising “free crypto” in exchange for deposits are also widespread—real giveaways never require you to send money first.

To protect yourself, be cautious of promises of guaranteed returns or pressure to act quickly. Always verify platforms, emails and offers through official sources. Use secure wallets, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and never share your private keys or recovery phrases.

If you fall victim to a scam, report it to the relevant platform and authorities immediately. While recovering lost funds can be difficult, staying informed and vigilant can help you avoid future traps. Crypto offers great potential, but your best defense is knowledge and caution.

Bottom Line

Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is an accessible way to grow wealth while supporting blockchain innovation. From staking to running masternodes, there are methods for every skill level and risk tolerance. Diversify strategies, research thoroughly and start small to navigate the crypto ecosystem confidently. With patience and planning, you can maximize passive crypto earnings.",neutral,neutral,0.8538343012332916,neutral,0.9846040308475494,neutral,0.9929911196231842,"['positve', 'negative', 'neutral']","[0.5109463781118393, 0.3729217955842614, 0.008349839597940445]",positive,0.5109463781118393

What if the secret isn’t about earning more but about making your money work harder? That’s where compound interest comes in, it’s like planting a tree that grows bigger every year, giving you more fruit season after season. The sooner you start, the more fruitful it becomes. Let’s break it down and explore why starting early can make your future in finance a breeze.

What Exactly Is Compound Interest?

Here’s the thing: compound interest might sound complicated, but it’s actually super simple. Think of it like this, when you save money in an account that earns interest, the bank pays you a little extra for keeping your cash with them. Now, here’s where the magic happens. Instead of just earning interest on your initial deposit (that’s called simple interest), compound interest pays you interest on both the money you put in and the interest you’ve already earned. It’s like earning interest on your interest.

For example, let’s say you deposit $1,000 in a savings account with a 5% annual interest rate. By the end of the first year, you’ll have $1,050. In year two, you earn interest not just on the $1,000 but on the entire $1,050, bringing your total to $1,102.50. Over time, this snowballs, by year ten, your account would grow to approximately $1,628.89, even if you didn’t add another penny. Sounds pretty cool, right?

Why Starting Early Matters So Much

Let’s be real, time is your best friend when it comes to growing wealth. The earlier you start saving, the longer your money has to grow. It’s like planting a tree when you’re young. If you plant it in your 20s, it’ll be towering by the time you retire. But if you wait until your 40s, it’s going to be much smaller, no matter how much fertilizer you use.

Starting early also gives you a financial cushion. Want to travel the world, buy a home, or retire comfortably? The money you save in your 20s and 30s will work harder for you than any last-minute savings scramble in your 50s. Plus, you’ll thank yourself later when you’re not stressed about meeting financial goals.

Strategies to Make the Most of Compound Interest

Ready to make your money grow like never before? Here are some simple, actionable strategies to unlock the full potential of compound interest and set yourself up for long-term success.

Automate Your Savings

Let’s face it, saving consistently can be tough. That’s why automation is a game-changer. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to a savings or investment account. It’s like putting your financial future on autopilot. Out of sight, out of mind, and into your savings it goes.

Reinvest Your Earnings

When you earn interest or dividends, reinvest them instead of cashing out. It might be tempting to use that extra money now, but keeping it invested means even bigger returns in the future. Think of it as adding more fuel to your money-making engine.

Avoid High Fees

Fees can be sneaky wealth killers. Whether it’s a high management fee on an investment account or hidden costs in a savings plan, these can eat into your earnings. Look for low-cost or no-fee accounts to maximize your returns.

The Best Tools to Harness Compound Interest

Choosing the right accounts and tools can make all the difference in how effectively you harness the power of compound interest to grow your wealth.

High-Yield Savings Accounts

If you’re looking for a low-risk way to grow your money, high-yield savings accounts are a solid option. They offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, helping your money grow faster. Perfect for short-term goals or an emergency fund.

401(k) Plans

If your employer offers a 401(k), jump on it. Employer matching is basically free money, and the tax benefits are a nice bonus. Contributing even a small percentage of your income can add up significantly over time.

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

For long-term goals like retirement, IRAs are worth considering. They come in two flavors: traditional and Roth, each with unique tax advantages. By exploring your IRA options, you can discover the best accounts to match your financial goals, offering benefits like tax advantages, portfolio diversification, and long-term retirement security Whether you’re just starting out or looking to diversify, an IRA is a powerful tool to leverage compound interest over decades.

Tips to Get Started Today

Review Your Progress: Life changes, and so should your financial plan. Check-in on your accounts periodically to make sure you’re on track. Adjust contributions or explore new investment opportunities as needed.

Why Waiting Costs More Than You Think

By opting for whole life insurance, you not only provide your loved ones with financial protection but also build a long-term savings strategy.

This type of insurance has the added benefit of accumulating cash value over time, growing at a guaranteed rate. Whether you’re saving for retirement, education, or other financial goals, whole life insurance offers a structured and secure path to help you reach them.

Understanding Whole Life Insurance: A Key to Long-Term Stability

Whole life insurance provides coverage as long as premiums are paid and ensures that your loved ones are secured financially, no matter when an unexpected event occurs.

What sets whole life insurance apart is its ability to accumulate cash value over time. Part of the premiums you pay contribute to a savings component that increases at a guaranteed rate. This makes whole life insurance an option not just for coverage but also for long-term financial stability.

Financial Benefits of Whole Life Insurance

One of the main reasons that people choose whole life insurance is the financial benefits it provides. Here’s how it can help with your financial goals:

– Fixed Premiums: Your premium amount remains the same throughout the life of the policy. This predictability can help you maintain your budget over the long term.

– Cash Value Growth: The cash value increases at a guaranteed rate, which is a significant advantage compared to other savings options that may be subject to market fluctuations.

– Tax-deferred Growth: The growth in your cash value is tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the growth of your policy until you withdraw the funds. This can make whole life insurance an attractive way to save money over time.

– Loans and Withdrawals: You can borrow money against the cash value of your whole life insurance policy. This gives you access to funds quickly, without the need for a loan. While it’s not a replacement for an emergency fund, it can be a helpful option in times of need.

Whole Life Insurance as a Tool for Wealth Building

Besides its primary purpose of providing life coverage, whole life insurance can also serve as a wealth-building tool. You can use the accumulated cash value to supplement retirement savings, fund education costs, or even invest in other financial opportunities.

Because the cash value is guaranteed to grow over time, it can offer a sense of security for your long-term financial planning. You may even be able to use your policy as a backup source of income, which is why many people see it as a strategic addition to their broader financial plan.

If you’re looking for a way to combine life insurance with a wealth-building strategy, whole life insurance might be just what you need. It provides both coverage and an opportunity for financial growth, which makes it unique in the world of insurance.

Key Considerations Before Choosing Whole Life Insurance

Before jumping into a whole life insurance policy, there are some important factors to consider. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

– Premium Costs: Whole life insurance premiums are typically higher than those for term life insurance. It’s important to ensure that the premiums fit within your budget and that you’re comfortable with the long-term financial commitment.

– Long-Term Commitment: While whole life insurance is an excellent tool for long-term stability, it’s not a quick fix. You need to be prepared for a long-term commitment to take the full benefits of the policy.

– Your Financial Goals: Consider how whole life insurance fits into your overall financial strategy. If your main goal is saving for retirement or building wealth, it can be a great option.

https://www.pfadvice.com/2025/01/24/simple-and-compound-interest-the-key-to-growing-your-savings-faster/,2025-01-24T14:36:35Z,"Are you tired of watching your hard-earned money sit idle in a low-yield savings account? Simple and compound interest might just be the financial superpowers that can turbocharge your wealth-building strategy. These aren’t just boring financial concepts—they’re your secret weapons for turning modest savings into impressive financial growth. Let’s break down these powerful financial concepts and see how they can make a difference in your financial journey.

1. What Is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is a straightforward way to calculate how much your money can grow over time. It is determined by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate and the time period. Unlike other methods, the interest earned here does not compound—it’s calculated on the original principal alone. For example, if you invest $1,000 at a 5% annual interest rate for three years, you’ll earn $150 in total. This makes simple interest an easy-to-understand and predictable way to grow savings.

2. How Compound Interest Works

Compound interest is often referred to as “interest on interest,” and it’s where the magic happens. Unlike simple interest, it allows you to earn interest on your initial principal as well as on any previously earned interest. Over time, this snowball effect can significantly boost your savings. For example, if you invest $1,000 at a 5% annual compound interest rate, your balance grows faster each year because the interest compounds. This method rewards patience, as the longer you keep your money invested, the greater the growth.

3. Comparing Simple and Compound Interest

The difference between simple and compound interests lies in how they calculate earnings. Simple interest remains fixed, while compound interest grows exponentially over time. For short-term goals, simple interest might suffice, but compound interest is ideal for long-term wealth creation. Imagine saving for retirement: compound interest can turn small, consistent contributions into a substantial nest egg. Understanding the nuances of these two methods helps you choose the right savings strategy.

4. Why Time Matters in Interest Calculations

Time plays a pivotal role in both interest calculations. The longer your money stays invested, the more you can benefit—especially with compound interest. For instance, starting to save at age 25 rather than 35 could mean thousands of extra dollars by retirement. Many financial advisors often recommend setting aside 15% to 20% of your income for retirement. Early saving allows compound interest more time to work its magic. This highlights why financial experts stress the importance of starting your savings journey early.

5. Practical Applications of Simple Interest

Simple interest is commonly used in short-term financial products such as personal loans, car loans, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Its predictable nature makes it ideal for borrowers and investors who prefer fixed returns. For example, a one-year fixed deposit earning simple interest ensures you know exactly how much you’ll get at the end of the term. While it may not yield high returns compared to compound interest, it’s a safe option for short-term goals. Familiarity with simple interest can help you evaluate loan offers and investment opportunities.

6. Where Compound Interest Shines

This is the foundation of long-term financial growth. It’s widely used in savings accounts, retirement plans, and investment portfolios. This method excels in maximizing returns over extended periods. For example, by contributing regularly to a retirement account that earns compound interest, you can accumulate significant wealth by retirement age. The power of compounding makes it an essential tool for achieving big financial milestones.

7. Tips for Maximizing Your Savings

To make the most of simple and compound interests, adopt smart saving habits. Start by setting clear financial goals and creating a budget to allocate funds for savings and investments. Opt for high-interest savings accounts or investment vehicles that offer compound interest. Consistency is key: make regular contributions to your savings. Finally, be patient and give your investments time to grow.

Unlock Your Financial Growth with Interest
